=======================
 Using This Repository
=======================

This repository is for tracking release requests for OpenStack
projects. The releases are managed using groups of "deliverables",
made up of individual project repositories sharing a Launchpad group
and a version number history. Many deliverables will only have one
constituent project.

Defining a Deliverable
======================

A "deliverable" is a unit of distribution of a useful project. It may
be a single library or several server components that are packaged
separately but released and used together. Rather than base the
definition on technical terms such as packaging, we use the social
organization of the project to identify deliverables. If the contents
of two repositories share a bug reporting tool so that bugs for the
contents of both repositories are mixed together and use the same
version numbers for all releases (e.g., one launchpad project), they
are both part of the same deliverable.

Within this repository, each deliverable is represented by a separate
file within the release series directory or the _independent
directory. The data that needs to go into each file is described in
detail below. All automated manipulation of the deliverable is managed
through the data file, which is reviewed by the core team when the
patch is proposed to openstack/releases.

Adding Deliverables
===================

In order to be considered to be included in the release for a given
series, the project must be documented by adding a deliverable file to
this repository before the second milestone of the series. Exceptions
will be considered by the release team on a case-by-case basis.

Requesting a Release
====================

The PTL or release liaison for a project may request a release from
master by submitting a patch to this repository, appending the necessary
release metadata to the file describing the deliverable to be
released. The release team will review the request and provide
feedback about the version number.

The stable maintenance team, PTL, or release liaison for a project may
request a release from a stable branch by submitting a patch to this
repository, appending the necessary release metadata to the file
describing the deliverable to be released. The release team will
review the request and provide feedback about the version number. If
the stable release is requested by the stable maintenance team, it
should be acknowledged by the PTL or release liaison to ensure that
the development team is aware of the coming change.

Prepare the release request by submitting a patch to this
repository.

* Always add the new release to the end of the list being edited. The
  version numbers will be reordered for display.

* Always pick new version numbers for new releases. We do not update
  the contents of previously tagged releases, because that confuses
  users who have already downloaded those packages.

* Make sure you follow semantic versioning rules `semver
  <http://semver.org/>`_ when picking the version number.

  In particular, if there is a change going into this release which
  requires a higher minimum version of a dependency, then the
  **minor** version should be incremented.

  .. note::

     The exception to this rule is when the versions of a project are
     pinned between minor versions in stable branches. In those cases
     we frequently release global-requirements syncs with a patch
     version to fix the target branch, e.g. stable/juno, but don't
     increment the minor version to avoid it being used in a different
     branch, like stable/kilo.  Someone from the `stable-maint-core
     <https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/530,members>`_ team
     should +1 a change like this before it's approved.

* Do not increment version numbers artificially to maintain
  consistent versions between deliverables. We expect versions of
  compatible deliverables to drift apart over time, and made the
  decision to embrace this by using other tools to document for users
  which combinations of packages go together.

  http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-June/065992.html

  If two build artifacts always need to have the same version number,
  that implies strongly that they are part of the same deliverable
  and should not be released separately.

* Start version numbers with 0.1.0 for unstable early editions and
  prototypes. Switch to 1.0.0 for the first production-ready
  release. Do not release the first version of a deliverable with a
  number that matches the version used by other existing related
  deliverables. This confuses consumers about the maturity of the new
  deliverable and about where they should find "older" versions with
  lower numbers, which do not exist.

* Set the first line (summary) of the commit message to the package
  name and version being requested.

* If you are not the release liaison or PTL, have the PTL of the
  project acknowledge the request with a +1.

* Do not use the "Depends-On" feature of zuul to make a release
  request depend on merging another patch in your project. The
  dependency management does not work properly in the release check
  jobs, and the validator requires that the patch listed in your
  deliverable file actually be merged into a proper branch.

* Do not submit multiple dependent patches for multiple
  releases. Having a patch series with multiple releases means the
  release team cannot properly prioritize processing them. During
  milestone weeks, preference is given to milestone
  releases. Releases from stable branches, independent projects, and
  other types of releases are processed later. If your milestone
  release request depends on a request that is deprioritized, you may
  miss the deadline.

* RC1 tags and stable branches should be submitted together for
  projects using the cycle-with-rc release model.

Using new-release command
=========================

The releases repository contains several tools to make working with
the data files easier. The new-release command, for example,
calculates new version numbers based on the semantic versioning
information given on the command line and determines the SHA of the
HEAD of the appropriate branch.

Use the ``venv`` tox environment to run the tool, like this:

::

   $ tox -e venv -- new-release SERIES DELIVERABLE TYPE

The SERIES value should be the release series, such as "pike".

The DELIVERABLE value should be the deliverable name, such as
"oslo.config" or "cinder".

The TYPE value should be one of:

``bugfix`` -- For a release containing only bug fixes.

``feature`` -- For a release with a new feature, a new dependency, or
a change to the minimum allowed version of a dependency.

``major`` -- For a release with a backwards-incompatible change.

``milestone`` -- For a date-based milestone tag.

``rc`` -- For a release candidate.

new-series automatically includes a stable branch for the first
release candidate.

If the most recent release of cinder during the pike series is
11.0.0.0b3 then running:

::

   $ tox -e venv -- new-release pike cinder rc

detects that this is the first release candidate and updates the file
deliverables/pike/cinder.yaml with the new release and a new stable
branch.

If a deliverable includes multiple git repositories, all of the
repositories are included in the new release unless their HEAD version
matches the most recent release from that repository. To re-tag in
those cases, use the ``--force`` option.

Use the ``--stable-branch`` option to also create a stable branch for the
new release. Projects following the cycle-with-rc release
model automatically receive a new stable branch on their first release
candidate.

Requesting a Branch
===================

The PTL or release liaison for a project may request a new branch by
submitting a patch to this repository, adding the necessary branch
metadata to the file describing the deliverable to be released. The
release team will review the request and provide feedback about the
branch point and possibly the name.

Prepare the branch request by submitting a patch to this repository.

* RC1 tags and stable branches should be submitted together for
  projects using the cycle-with-rc release model.

* Always add the new branch to the end of the list in the file being
  edited.

* Branches should use one of the standard prefixes:

  ``stable/`` -- for stable series

  ``feature/`` -- for temporary feature branches

* ``stable/`` branch names must match a valid series name.

* If you are not the release liaison or PTL, have the PTL of the
  project acknowledge the request with a +1.

* Do not use the "Depends-On" feature of zuul to make a branch
  request depend on merging another patch in your project. The
  dependency management does not work properly in the release check
  jobs, and the validator requires that the patch listed in your
  deliverable file actually be merged into a proper branch.

Release Approval
================

Releases will only be denied during freeze weeks, periods where there
are known gate issues, or when releasing will introduce unwanted
instability. Releases made late in a week may be delayed until early
in the next week unless there is a pressing need such as a gate
failure or security issue.

Who is Responsible for the Release?
===================================

The release team is responsible for helping to clearly signal the
nature of the changes in the release through good version number
selection.

The project team is responsible for understanding the implications for
consuming projects when a new release is made, and ensuring that
releases do not break other projects. When breaks occur, the project
team is responsible for taking the necessary corrective action.

Deliverable Files
=================

Deliverable repositories for projects using cycle_with_intermediary
or cycle_with_milestones should be placed in their respective releases
within the deliverables directory. Deliverable repositories for
projects using the independent release model should be placed in the
``deliverables/_independent`` directory.

For a deliverable set of projects, we use one YAML file per release
series to hold all of the metadata for all releases and branches of
that deliverable. For each deliverable, we need to track:

* the launchpad project name (such as ``oslo.config``) or storyboard
  project id (such as ``760``)
* the series (Kilo, Liberty, etc.)
* the release model being used
* for each repository

  * the name (such as ``openstack/oslo.config``)
  * the hash of the commit to be tagged
  * the version number to use

* cycle highlights that will be published to
  ``releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/highlights.html`` (optional, and for
  cycle-with-intermediary and cycle-with-rc projects only)
* the starting points of all branches

We track this metadata for the history of all releases of the
deliverable, so we can render a set of release history documentation.

The file should be named based on the deliverable to be tagged, so
releases for ``liberty`` from the ``openstack/oslo.config``
repository will have a file in ``openstack/releases`` called
``deliverables/liberty/oslo.config.yaml``. Releases of the same
deliverable from the ``stable/kilo`` branch will be described by
``deliverables/kilo/oslo.config.yaml``.

Deliverables File Schema
========================

The top level of a deliverable file is a mapping with keys:

``team``
  The name of the team that owns the deliverable, as listed in the
  governance repository data files.

``launchpad``
  The slug name of the launchpad project, suitable for use in URLs.
  (Not needed for projects using storyboard.)

``storyboard``
  The ID of the storyboard project, suitable for use in URLs and API
  calls.  (Not needed for projects using launchpad.)

``release-notes``
  The URL or URLs to the published release notes for the deliverable
  for the series.

  Deliverables contained a single repository should simply include the
  URL to the notes for that repository. Deliverables made up of
  multiple repositories should use a hash to map each repository name
  to its notes URL.

``include-pypi-link``
  Either ``true`` or ``false``, indicating whether the release
  announcement should include the link to the package on
  PyPI. Defaults to ``false``.

``release-model``
  Identify the release model used by the deliverable. See
  the reference section of the documentation for descriptions
  of the valid models.

``type``
  Categorize the deliverable based on what it does. See the reference
  section of the documentation for descriptions of the valid
  deliverable types.

``artifact-link-mode``
  Describe how to link to artifacts produced by the project. The
  default is ``tarball``. Valid values are:

  ``tarball``
    Automatically generates links to version-specific files on
    tarballs.openstack.org.

  ``none``
    Do not link to anything, just show the version number.

``repository-settings``
  Mapping of special settings to control the behavior for each repository,
  keyed by the repository name.

  ``flags``
    A list of flags attached to the repository.

    ``no-artifact-build-job``
      This repository has no job for building an artifact, but should
      be tagged anyway.

    ``retired``
      This repository is no longer used, but was present in old
      versions of a deliverable.

  ``pypi-name``
    An optional name for the deliverable on pypi.python.org.  This
    value is only needed if the name on PyPI does not match the
    canonicalized output of ``python setup.py --name``, such as if it
    uses capitalized letters ("DragonFlow" instead of "dragonflow").

  ``tarball-base``
    An optional name for the base of the tarball created by the
    release. If no value is provided, it defaults to the repo base name or
    an overridden value set on a specific release entry under ``releases``.

``release-type``
  This (optional) key sets the level of validation for the versions numbers.

  ``python-service``
    Default: Enforces 3 digit semver version numbers in releases and allows
    for common alpha, beta and dev releases.  This should be appropriate for
    most OpenStack component release requirements.

  ``python-pypi``
    Like ``python-service`` but requires the jobs to publish the component
    to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

  ``xstatic``
    Allows a more flexible versioning in line with xstatic package guidelines
    and requirements.

  ``fuel``
    The Fuel project manages its own packages.

  ``puppet``
    All puppet modules should use this. If no release-type is
    specified and the validation job can determine that a module is a
    puppet module, it assumes a release-type of ``puppet``.

  ``nodejs``
    All nodejs modules should use this. If no release-type is
    specified and the validation job can determine that a module is a
    nodejs module, it assumes a release-type of ``nodejs``.

  ``neutron``
    For projects using the PyPI publishing variant that installs
    neutron in order to build the package. Typically used by neutron
    plugins.

  ``horizon``
    For projects using the PyPI publishing variant that installs
    horizon in order to build the package. Typically used by horizon
    plugins.

``releases``
  A list of the releases for the deliverable.

``stable-branch-type``
  This (optional) key sets the validation for the location associated
  with each stable branch.

  ``std``
    Default: Requires stable branches to be created from tagged
    releases. This is the correct branch type for most projects.

    The location must be either an existing version tag or the most
    recently added version number under the releases list (allowing a
    tag and branch to be submitted together).  All repositories
    associated with the version (as identified by the deliverable
    file) will be branched from that version using the name given.

  ``std-with-versions``
    This mode has the same meaning as the ``std`` branch type, with the
    addition that version-based branches can be created as well.

    These version-based branches are shorter term stable branches that
    are named for the major and minor version number (e.g. bugfix/3.1).
    This is primarily used for Ironic releases.

  ``tagless``
    This mode requires stable branch locations to be a mapping between
    repository name and an existing commit, specified by the
    hash. This mode should only be used for projects that do not tag
    releases, such as devstack and grenade.

  ``upstream``
    Stable branch names track upstream release names, rather than
    OpenStack series names.

  ``none``
    This mode indicates that the deliverable should never have stable
    branches. This is used for specific deliverables like tempest
    or patrole.

``cycle-highlights``
  A list of plain-text bullet points describing some of the top new
  features or changes you would like to point out for this release
  cycle. Minimal RST markup is supported. These highlights are
  compiled per team and published to
  ``releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/highlights.html``.

``branches``
  A list of the branches for the deliverable.

Each ``release`` entry is a mapping with keys:

``version``
  The version tag for that release, to be applied to all of the member
  projects.

``projects``
  A list of all of the projects making up the deliverable for that
  release.

``highlights``
  An optional message to be included in the release note email
  announcing the release. (Use ``|`` to indicate a multi-line,
  pre-formatted message.)

``flags``
  A list of flags attached to the release.

  ``forced``
    This release was applied by the release team, and not the project
    team.

  ``skipped-sig``
    This independent release pre-dates the Ocata cycle and did not
    generate any signature. Signature link display should be skipped
    when the release website pages are generated.

Each entry in the ``projects`` list is a mapping with keys:

``repo``
  The name of the repository on git.openstack.org.

``hash``
  The SHA1 hash for the commit to receive the version tag.

``tarball-base``
  An optional name for the base of the tarball created by the
  release. If no value is provided, it defaults to the ``repository-settings``
  value if set, else the repo base name.

Each entry in the ``branches`` list is a mapping with keys:

``name``
  The name of the branch.

``location``
  The location value depends on the name.

  If a branch name starts with stable/ then the location value depends
  on the ``stable-branch-type`` setting.

  If a branch name starts with feature/ then the location must be a
  mapping between the target repository name and the SHA of a commit
  already in the target repository.


Examples
========

For example, one version of
``deliverables/liberty/oslo.config.yaml`` might contain::

   ---
   launchpad: oslo.config
   branches:
     - name: feature/random-feature-work
       location:
         openstack/oslo.config: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39
   releases:
     - version: 1.12.0
       projects:
         - repo: openstack/oslo.config
           hash: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39

and then for the subsequent release it would be updated to contain::

   ---
   launchpad: oslo.config
   branches:
     - name: feature/random-feature-work
       location:
         openstack/oslo.config: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39
     - name: stable/newton
       location: 1.12.1
   releases:
     - version: 1.12.0
       projects:
         - repo: openstack/oslo.config
           hash: 02a86d2eefeda5144ea8c39657aed24b8b0c9a39
     - version: 1.12.1
       projects:
         - repo: openstack/oslo.config
           hash: 0c9113f68285f7b55ca01f0bbb5ce6cddada5023
       highlights: |
          This release includes the change to stop importing
          from the 'oslo' namespace package.

For deliverables with multiple repositories, the list of projects
would contain all of them. For example, the Neutron deliverable might
be described by ``deliverables/mitaka/neutron.yaml`` containing:

::

   ---
   launchpad: neutron
   release-notes:
     openstack/neutron: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/mitaka.html
     openstack/neutron-lbaas: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron-lbaas/mitaka.html
     openstack/neutron-fwaas: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron-fwaas/mitaka.html
     openstack/neutron-vpnaas: https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron-vpnaas/mitaka.html
   releases:
    - version: 8.0.0
      projects:
        - repo: openstack/neutron
          hash: 3213eb124e40b130e174ac3a91067e2b196788dd
        - repo: openstack/neutron-fwaas
          hash: ab5622891e2b1a7631f97471f55ffb9b5235e5ee
        - repo: openstack/neutron-lbaas
          hash: 19b18f05037dae4bbbada848aae6421da18ab490
        - repo: openstack/neutron-vpnaas
          hash: a1b12601a64a2359b2224fd4406c5db008484700

To allow tagging for repositories without build artifacts, set the
``no-artifact-build-job`` flag.

::

    ---
    launchpad: astara
    repository-settings:
      openstack/astara-appliance:
        flags:
          - no-artifact-build-job
    releases:
      - version: 9.0.0.0b1
        projects:
          - repo: openstack/astara-appliance
            hash: c21a64ea7b3b0fbdab8592afecdd31d9b8e64a6a

Helpers
=======

In order to help build out these files there are various command line
based tools that come with this repository. To install these it is as
easy as ``pip install .`` in this repository directory.

* ``new-release`` takes arguments to describe a new release and
  updates the deliverable file, automatically calculating the version
  number
* ``edit-deliverable`` takes arguments to update the contents of a
  single deliverable file
* ``list-changes`` that lists the changes in a given release file.
* ``interactive-release`` that goes through a *wizard* style set of
  questions to produce a new or updated release of a given project or
  set of projects.
* ``missing-releases`` scans deliverable files and verifies that all
  of the releases that should have been tagged by hand have been
* ``init-series`` initializes a new deliverable directory with stub
  files based on the previous release.
* ``get-contacts`` Loads the governance and liaison data to print contact
  deatils for a given team

tools/aclmanager.py
-------------------

A script to handle pre-release/post-release ACLs on stable/$SERIES
branches.

The 'acls' action helps to produce a patch over
openstack-infra/project-config that inserts a specific ACL for
stable/$SERIES.

The 'groups' action helps to adjust the membership of
$PROJ-release-branch Gerrit group, based on which stage the release
branch is at. At pre-release we remove $PROJ-stable-maint, and add the
$PROJ-release and Release Managers group (pre_release subaction). At
post-release, we remove $PROJ-release and Release Managers, and add
$PROJ-stable-maint (post_release subaction).

Examples:

To create the ACL patch for stable/newton:

::

  tox -e aclmanager -- --series newton acls ~/branches/openstack-infra/project-config

To set the pre-release group membership:

::

  tox -e aclmanager -- groups pre_release ttx

tools/add_reviewers.sh
----------------------

A script to add the PTL and release liaisons to one or more reviews.

Around deadlines during the cycle, and especially near the end of the cycle,
the release team needs to generate a large number of release patches for
various subsets of the included deliverables. The ``add_reviewers.sh`` script
can be used to make sure the appropriate people have been added as reveiwers
for these reviews.

For example, assuming the release candidate patches for the Ussuri cycle are
generated using the Gerrit review topic of ``ussuri-rc``, the following will
process all of those reviews to add the necessary PTL and liaison reviewers::

  ./tools/add_reviewers.sh ussuri-rc

Note that any topic may be used, so this script can be used even if just
adding reviewers to an individual review.

tools/check_approval.py
-----------------------

A script to test that release requests have been approved by a team
liaison.

Example:

::

  tox -e check_approval -- 695375

tools/bulk_review.sh
--------------------

A script for taking a working directory and dividing up the modified files into
a collection on independent per-team reviews.  Each per-team change should be
able to be processed in any order.  These reviews will request review from the
the PTL and all release liaisons.

This is designed to be used by the release team at key points in the cycle to
ease bulk releases.

.. note::

  This tool will commit ultimately commit all modified deliverables and
  modifies git state.  Therefore it is essential that before running it
  the working tree contains only the logical changes appropriate for the
  stage of the release *and* all changes are saved elsewhere, in case the
  script encounters a problem.


tools/make_missing_releases.sh
------------------------------

A wrapper script around ``new-release`` designed to be run by the release team
to create releases at appropriate times in the release cycle, e.g milestones.
Once ``tools/make_missing_releases.sh`` completes the release manager can use
``tools/bulk_review.sh`` to submit the release requests.

tools/process_auto_releases.sh
------------------------------

Automates parts of the process to propose releases for a large set of
deliverables.

There are multiple points during the release cycle where the release team
needs to initiate releases for library releases, tagging RCs, or other cases
where we need to inspect each deliverable in a set to generate release
requests.

This tool asks for input on a few common settings to use for the releases. A
template commit message is entered on the command line, using the placeholder
of PROJECT that will be replaced by the actual deliverable name. It then
iterates through a set of deliverables and shows any commits to the relevant
repos that have not been included in a release yet. You are then able to
decide whether it needs to be released and select the release type
(major, minor, bugfix, rc, etc.) based on the included commits.

This can be used in conjunction with the ``list-deliverables`` command to get
the specific deliverables to process. An example use would be::

   ./tools/process_auto_releases.sh ussuri $(list-deliverables --unreleased --series ussuri)

As an alternative, it may be useful to be able to edit the list of deliverables
before running the command. That can be done by something similar to::

   tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased --series ussuri > deliverables.log
   vi deliverables.log  # edit contents as needed
   ./tools/process_auto_releases.sh ussuri $(cat deliverables.log)

Unlike make_missing_releases.sh, this script will create fresh temporary clones
of each repo to avoid stale information, and it will submit each new release
request as it goes.

tools/releases_note_links.sh
------------------------------

A script to add the missing release note links to deliverables if needed.

This script is designed to be run by the release team
to ensure that release note links are present in deliverables at appropriate
times in the release cycle, e.g milestones.

Example:

To check for ussuri release note links:

::

  tools/add_release_note_links.sh ussuri

tools/search_email.py
---------------------

A script to search emails on the openstack-discuss mailing list. By default
this script will search for emails related to the release team, but
topic can be overriden to looking for specific subjects.

Examples:

The most basic example is the following, it will search for emails related
to releases topics on openstack-discuss during the entire life of
this mailing list (between the creation date in November 2018 to
the current date):

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py

To looking for emails related to release and filtered between 2 dates:

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py --starting-date 2020-04-01 --ending-date 2020-4-1

To looking for emails related to release and filtered by authors:

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py --authors "Herve Beraud" "Sean McGinnis"

To looking for emails related to release between 2 dates and sent by authors:

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py --starting-date 2020-04-01 --ending-date 2020-4-1 --authors "Herve Beraud" "Sean McGinnis"

To looking for emails related to release FFE since August 2020:

::
  $ tools/search_emails.py --topic ".?\[release\].*FFE.*" --starting-date 2020-8-1

To looking for all the release countdown emails sent during victoria:

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py --topic ".?\[release\] Release countdown.*" --starting-date 2020-5-1

By default will be executed on ``http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss``
but you can change the url to execute research on different mailing list.

In the following example we looking for all release jobs who failed for ``openstack/watcher*``:

::

  $ tools/search_emails.py --topic ".?openstack/watcher.*" --mailing-list http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/
  release-job-failures/ --starting-date 2016-6-1

Notice that by default we search on ``http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-discuss``
and this mailing list was created in November 2018 so the ``--starting-date``
is initialized to this date by default, but the date can't be before this
default date except if you search on a different mailing list and if you also
override it by passing params with ``--mailing-list``.

For more usage and examples:

::
  $ tools/search_emails.py -h

tools/list_eol_stale_branches.sh
---------------------------------

A script to detect deliverables who have EOL stale branches and optionally
delete them.

Example:

::

  tools/list_eol_stale_branches.sh

Another example with predefining the gerrit user to be used for branch deletion:

::

  GERRIT_USER=<gerrit_user_name> tools/list_eol_stale_branches.sh

The reason behind this tool is that since the Extended Maintenance model
have been introduced we stopped removing automatically End of Life (EOL)
branches. This tool aims to list projects with branches that have been
declared ``End of Life`` (that is, tagged with ``$series-eol``), but the
corresponding series branch still exists. The script also offers to delete
these stale branches.

.. note::

   Only release managers have the access rights to delete branches.

tools/list_unbranched_projects.sh
---------------------------------

A script to detect deliverables who haven't been branched during previous
series.

Example:

::

  tools/list_unbranched_projects.sh

This tooling aim to avoid to miss branching. This is a side effect of
the trailing projects, each series some of them are missed and remain
unbranched. We faced similar use case previously and that led us to
issues during releasing on stable branches.


tools/membership_freeze_test.py
--------------------------------

A script to test for new deliverables in governance that were
never under release management and therefore escape any form of
release management tracking.

Those need to be checked around milestone-2 (before MembershipFreeze)
so that we create deliverable files for them if they are to be part of
the final release.

Example:

To check for Stein release:

::

  tox -e membership_freeze_test -- stein ~/branches/governance/reference/projects.yaml

This script generate can generate a project url and append it to each results found
simply by adding the flag `--url` to your command.

By default the generated urls use the official git repository
(https://git.openstack.org) but you can use another one like github or your
specific dist git url by adding the option `--distgit <base-url>` to your command.

Example:

::

  tox -e membership_freeze_test -- stein ~/branches/governance/reference/projects.yaml --url --distgit https://github.com/

propose-final-releases
----------------------

Command to edit the deliverable files in a releases repository to
propose final releases. The command modifies files in an existing copy
of the repository and does not invoke git at all, so you need to
create a branch before running it then review the output, commit the
changes, and push the patch to gerrit.

::

  tox -e venv -- propose-final-releases newton ocata

propose-library-branches
------------------------

Command to edit the deliverable files in a releases repository to
propose stable branches for libraries. The command modifies files in
an existing copy of the repository and does not invoke git at all, so
you need to create a branch before running it then review the output,
commit the changes, and push the patch to gerrit.

::

  tox -e venv -- propose-library-branches
  tox -e venv -- propose-library-branches pike

tools/list_unreleased_changes.sh
--------------------------------

Given a branch and one or more repositories, produce a list of the
changes in those repositories since their last tag on that
branch. This is useful for deciding if a project needs to prepare a
release, and for predicting what the next release version should be by
looking at the commit logs.

::

  ./tools/list_unreleased_changes.sh master openstack/oslo.config

Print the list of changes in ``openstack/oslo.config`` along the
master branch.

tools/list_unreleased_changes_for_team.sh
-----------------------------------------

Given a series and team name, produce a list of the changes in the
repositories for that team since their last tag on that branch. This
is useful for deciding if a project needs to prepare a release, and
for predicting what the next release version should be by looking at
the commit logs.

::

  ./tools/list_unreleased_changes_for_team.sh stein oslo

Print the list of changes in Oslo team repositories along the branch
for the stein release ('master' before the release and 'stable/stein'
after the release).

tools/list_library_unreleased_changes.sh
----------------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh for all libraries managed by any
project.

list_stable_unreleased_changes.sh
---------------------------------

Runs list_unreleased_changes.sh with the given branch for all
repositories.


::

  ./list_stable_unreleased_changes.sh stable/liberty


is equivalent to:

::

  ./list_unreleased_changes.sh stable/liberty $(list-deliverables --repos --series liberty)

list-em-series
--------------

Command to list all series tagged as in extended maintenance.

::

  tox -e venv -- list-em-series
