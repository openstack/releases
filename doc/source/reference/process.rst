===================
 Release Processes
===================

This document describes the process and week-per-week steps related to
preparing the release. It should be adapted to take team holidays and
other commitments into account, and turned into a clear action plan for
the release cycle.

Week after previous release
===========================

#. Process any late or blocked release requests for deliverables
   for any branch (treating the new series branch as stable).

#. Prepare for the next release cycle by adding deliverable files under the
   next cycle's directory. Remove any deliverable files from the current cycle
   that ended up not having any releases. Then run the following command to use
   the current cycle deliverables to generate placeholders for the next cycle::

      tox -e venv -- init-series $SERIES $NEXT_SERIES


   Submit your changes by using the gerrit topic ``$series-init-series``.

   .. warning::

      At this point, the trailing deliverables of the previous series
      are not necessarily released yet. Adding them here is not an issue,
      however, we should be vigilant and ensure to create new releases
      for the previous series first.

#. Coordinate with the Infrastructure team to swap out the previous cycle
   signing key and establish the new one for the starting cycle.

#. Create the $series-relmgt-tracking etherpad using the
   ``make-tracking-etherpad`` command.
   For example::

       tox -e venv -- make-tracking-pad ussuri

   The output from this command can be pasted into a
   ``$SERIES-relmgt-tracking`` etherpad. Set title formatting for the top
   sections. Then highlight all listed weeks and set to **Heading 3** style.
   Fill in the contents of one of the weeks with the typical items, then copy
   and past that into each subsequent week to prepare for the rest of the
   cycle.

#. Email PTLs directly one time to explain the use of the "[release][ptl]"
   email tag on the openstack-discuss list and tell them to pay attention
   to [release] countdown emails. Use the following email template and
   send it with ``$SERIES Cycle Information`` as email subject::

    This email is going out to all PTLs and release liaisons for $SERIES.

    Welcome to the $SERIES series. On behalf of the release management team, I
    just wanted to say hello and make sure you had the information you need
    to know what to do and what to expect during this coming release cycle.

    Release Schedule
    ================

    If you haven't seen it yet, please take a look at the published schedule for
    this cycle:

        https://releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/schedule.html

    That lists all of the major milestones along the way as we work towards the
    coordinated release on $release-date.

    Community-wide deadlines are listed under the "Cross-project events" column.
    You may notice some projects have added project-specific deadlines under the
    "Project-specific events" column. That can be done by submitting a patch to the
    openstack/releases repo updating the doc/source/$SERIES/schedule.* files, if
    you would like to make sure those deadlines are published somewhere.

    Countdown Emails
    ================

    Throughout the cycle, we will be sending regular "countdown" emails to the
    openstack-discuss mailing list. If you have filtering set up for mailing list
    emails, please make sure you are not filtering out subject lines that contain
    "[release]" and "[ptl]" tags.

    These countdown emails will contain important updates on upcoming deadlines and
    information about necessary actions throughout the cycle. We try to keep them
    to a minimum, so earlier on in the cycle they will not be sent weekly, but
    around deadline times and especially towards the end of the cycle, these will
    go out weekly to make sure everyone has the information they need to get work
    done in time. Your attention to these emails would be appreciated. We will try
    to keep them short.

    Deliverables
    ============

    The release process may be new for a few of you. All official OpenStack
    deliverables are released by updating deliverable files in the
    openstack/releases repo:

        https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables/$SERIES

    Please take a look at your deliverable files and make sure the release-model
    matches what the team plans to follow for this cycle. This model is a way to
    communicate to downstream consumers what to expect, so the release team uses
    your declared model to determine when and how to enforce different steps during
    the cycle.

    Details on the release models and what they mean, as well as documentation on
    how to use the releases repo, can be found in the references section here:

        https://releases.openstack.org/index.html#references

    That has documentation for some of our tooling too. The most important one you
    may want to know about is the new-release tooling so you don't need to edit
    those yaml files directly. That command can be used like this:

        tools/new_release.sh $SERIES cinder feature

    The last part can be major (major version bump), feature (minor version bump),
    and bugfix (bugfix, or the Z in X.Y.Z).

    Reviews
    =======

    Because of the strict timing of the cycle schedule, it is important that you
    review release patches within some days or usually until Thursdays EOB if
    possible. Please look at the incoming review request emails (sent by gerrit)
    from openstack/releases repository regularly or at least check your inbox at
    least once or twice a week:

        https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/releases+reviewer:self+is:open

    The above link shows a customised list of release patches that only contains
    patches that you are added as reviewer. Release managers use a script to add
    PTLs and release liaisons to their relevant release patches as reviewers.

    Release Liaisons
    ================

    If anyone should be added as a release liaison, or removed, just submit a patch
    to update the data/release_liaisons.yaml file in the openstack/releases repo
    with current information for your team.


    Please contact us at any point with any questions. We can be reached on the
    openstack-discuss mailing list with the [release] tag, or on IRC in the
    #openstack-release channel.

    Thanks for your attention. I hope the $SERIES cycle goes well for everyone.

#. At the end of the week, send the following weekly email content::

    Welcome back to the release countdown emails! These will be sent at
    major points in the $SERIES development cycle, which should conclude
    with a final release on $release-date.

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    At this stage in the release cycle, focus should be on planning the
    $SERIES development cycle, assessing $SERIES community goals and approving
    $SERIES specs.

    General Information
    -------------------

    $remark-on-series-length. In case you haven't seen it yet, please take
    a look over the schedule for this release:

    https://releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/schedule.html

    By default, the team PTL is responsible for handling the release cycle
    and approving release requests. This task can (and probably should) be
    delegated to release liaisons. Now is a good time to review release
    liaison information for your team and make sure it is up to date:

    https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/data/release_liaisons.yaml

    By default, all your team deliverables from the $PREVIOUS_SERIES release are
    continued in $SERIES with a similar release model.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $other-upcoming-event_
    $SERIES-1 milestone: $milestone1


Week before milestone-1
=======================

#. Review cycle-trailing projects to check which haven't released yet.
   Ask them to prepare their releases, if they haven't already. The list
   of pending cycle-trailing deliverables can be determined by running
   the command::

     tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --series $LASTSERIES \
         --type trailing --missing-final

#. At the end of the week, send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    The $SERIES-1 milestone is next week, on $milestone1! Project team plans
    for the $SERIES cycle should now be solidified.

    General Information
    -------------------

    Libraries need to be released at least once per milestone period. Next
    week, the release team will propose releases for any library which had
    changes but has not been otherwise released since the $LASTSERIES release.
    PTL's or release liaisons, please watch for these and give a +1 to
    acknowledge them. If there is some reason to hold off on a release, let
    us know that as well, by posting a -1. If we do not hear anything at all
    by the end of the week, we will assume things are OK to proceed.

    NB: If one of your libraries is still releasing 0.x versions, start
    thinking about when it will be appropriate to do a 1.0 version. The
    version number does signal the state, real or perceived, of the library,
    so we strongly encourage going to a full major version once things are
    in a good and usable state.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $SERIES-1 milestone: $milestone1


Milestone-1
===========

#. Ensure that all trailing projects have been branched for the previous
   series.

   - List unbranched projects using::

       tools/list_unbranched_projects.sh

   - Propose a patch to branch the missing ones.

#. Propose autoreleases for cycle-with-intermediary libraries which
   did not release since the previous release.

   - List them using::

       tox -e venv -- \
            list-deliverables \
                --unreleased \
                --model cycle-with-intermediary \
                --type client-library \
                --type library \
       > /tmp/deliverables.log

   - Edit the generated file (``/tmp/deliverables.log``) to remove tox's logs.

   - Generate release requests for all cycle-with-intermediary libraries
     which had changes, but did not release since the previous release.

     .. warning::

        ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
        Please use ``$series-milestone-1`` as topic.

     For this, run (c.f `tools/process_auto_releases.sh
     <https://releases.openstack.org/reference/using.html#tools-process-auto-releases-sh>`__)::

       tools/process_auto_releases.sh $SERIES $(cat /tmp/deliverables.log)

     That patch will be used as a base to communicate with the team: if
     a team wants to wait for a specific patch to make it to the library,
     someone from the team can -1 the patch to have it held, or update
     that patch with a different commit SHA.

     Here is an example of milestone 1 generated for Wallaby:

     https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:%22w1-c-w-i%22


   - Between Tuesday and Thursday, merge as soon as possible the patches that
     get +1 from the PTL or the release liaison.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. To catch if there are acl issues in newly created repositories,
   run tools/aclissues.py to detect potential leftovers in Gerrit ACLs
   allowing official deliverables to be directly tagged or branched without
   going through openstack/releases. You need to specify the location
   of up-to-date checkouts for the governance and the project-config
   repositories. For example::

     tools/aclissues.py ../project-config ../governance

   If the tool reports any violation, you can re-run it with ``--patch`` to
   generate needed changes in ../project-config to align ACLs with governance,
   and propose the changes for review.

#. At the end of the week, send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We are now past the $SERIES-1 milestone. Teams should now be focused on
    feature development and completion of goals [0].

    [0] https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/selected/index.html

    General Information
    -------------------

    Our next milestone in this development cycle will be $SERIES-2, on
    $milestone2. This milestone is when we freeze the list of deliverables
    that will be included in the $SERIES final release, so if you plan to
    introduce new deliverables in this release, please propose a change to
    add an empty deliverable file in the deliverables/$SERIES directory of
    the openstack/releases repository.

    Now is also generally a good time to look at bugfixes that were
    introduced in the master branch that might make sense to be backported
    and released in a stable release.

    If you have any question around the OpenStack release process, feel free
    to ask on this mailing-list or on the #openstack-release channel on IRC.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $SERIES-2 Milestone: $milestone2


Week after milestone-1
======================

#. Review any remaining milestone-1 exceptions


Between Milestone-1 and Milestone-2
===================================

#. Send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    The $SERIES-2 milestone will happen in next month, on $milestone2.
    $SERIES-related specs should now be finalized so that teams can move
    to implementation ASAP. Some teams observe specific deadlines on
    the second milestone (mostly spec freezes): please refer to
    https://releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/schedule.html for details.

    General Information
    -------------------

    Please remember that libraries need to be released at least once per
    milestone period. At milestone 2, the release team will propose releases
    for any library that has not been otherwise released since milestone 1.

    Other non-library deliverables that follow the cycle-with-intermediary
    release model should have an intermediary release before milestone-2.
    Those who haven't will be proposed to switch to the cycle-with-rc model,
    which is more suited to deliverables that are released only once per cycle.

    At milestone-2 we also freeze the contents of the final release. If you
    have a new deliverable that should be included in the final release, you
    should make sure it has a deliverable file in:
    https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables/$series
    You should request a beta release (or intermediary release) for those new
    deliverables by milestone-2. We understand some may not be quite ready
    for a full release yet, but if you have something minimally viable to
    get released it would be good to do a 0.x release to exercise the release
    tooling for your deliverables. See the MembershipFreeze description for
    more details: https://releases.openstack.org/$SERIES/schedule.html#$S-mf

    Finally, now may be a good time for teams to check on any stable
    releases that need to be done for your deliverables. If you have
    bugfixes that have been backported, but no stable release getting
    those. If you are unsure what is out there committed but not released,
    in the openstack/releases repo, running the command
    "tools/list_stable_unreleased_changes.sh <cycle_name>" gives a nice report.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $SERIES-2 Milestone: $milestone2


Week before Milestone-2
=======================

#. Ahead of MembershipFreeze, run ``governance_consistency.py``::

     python3 tools/governance_consistency.py $series $project_yaml_file

   This tool will list all inconsistencies between the deliverables described
   in the governance's reference "projects.yaml" file and the deliverables
   defined in the $series directory or the _independent directory.
   There should ideally be none.

   For deliverables defined in governance but not in deliverable files,
   they should either be tagged as a release management exception if they do
   not need to be released (see ``release-management`` key in the governance
   projects.yaml file) or an empty deliverable file should be added to the
   series so that we can properly track it. Leftovers are considered too young
   to be released in the next release and will be reconsidered at the next
   cycle.

   For deliverables defined in deliverable files but not in (active)
   governance, their deliverable file should generally be removed from the
   $series directory, or marked release-model:abandoned if present in the
   _independent directory.

    Libraries need to be released at least once per milestone period. Next
    week, the release team will propose releases for any library that has not
    been otherwise released since milestone 1. PTL's and release liaisons,
    please watch for these and give a +1 to acknowledge them. If there is
    some reason to hold off on a release, let us know that as well. A +1
    would be appreciated, but if we do not hear anything at all by the end
    of the week, we will assume things are OK to proceed.

    Remember that non-library deliverables that follow the
    cycle-with-intermediary release model should have an intermediary
    release before milestone-2. Those who haven't will be proposed to switch
    to the cycle-with-rc model, which is more suited to deliverables that
    are released only once per cycle.

    Next week is also the deadline to freeze the contents of the final
    release. All new '$SERIES' deliverables need to have a deliverable file
    in https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables
    and need to have done a release by milestone-2.

    Changes proposing those deliverables for inclusion in $SERIES have been
    posted, please update them with an actual release request before the
    milestone-2 deadline if you plan on including that deliverable in $SERIES,
    or -1 if you need one more cycle to be ready.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $SERIES-2 Milestone: $milestone2


Milestone-2
===========

#. Generate a list of all cycle-with-intermediary libraries which did not
   release since the YYYY-MM-DD date of milestone-1. For this, run::

     tox -e venv -- \
        list-deliverables \
            --unreleased-since YYYY-MM-DD \
            --model cycle-with-intermediary \
            --type client-library \
            --type library \
     > /tmp/deliverables.log

   Then, edit the generated file to remove tox's logs.

   Generate release requests for all cycle-with-intermediary libraries
   which had changes, but did not release since milestone-1.

   .. warning::

      ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
      Please use ``$series-milestone-2`` as topic.

   For this, run (c.f `tools/process_auto_releases.sh
   <https://releases.openstack.org/reference/using.html#tools-process-auto-releases-sh>`__)::

     tools/process_auto_releases.sh $SERIES $(cat /tmp/deliverables.log)

   That patch will be used as a base to communicate with the team:
   if a team wants to wait for a specific patch to make it to the library,
   someone from the team can -1 the patch to have it held, or update
   that patch with a different commit SHA.

#. Send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We are now past the $SERIES-2 milestone, and entering the last development
    phase of the cycle. Teams should be focused on implementing planned work
    for the cycle.

    Now is a good time to review those plans and reprioritize anything if
    needed based on the what progress has been made and what looks realistic
    to complete in the next few weeks.

    General Information
    -------------------

    Looking ahead to the end of the release cycle, please be aware of the
    feature freeze dates. Those vary depending on deliverable type:

    * General libraries (except client libraries) need to have their last
      feature release before Non-client library freeze ($nclfreeze). Their
      stable branches are cut early.

    * Client libraries (think python-*client libraries) need to have their
      last feature release before Client library freeze ($milestone3)

    * Deliverables following a cycle-with-rc model (that would be most
      services) observe a Feature freeze on that same date, $milestone3.
      Any feature addition beyond that date should be discussed on the
      mailing-list and get PTL approval. After feature freeze, cycle-with-rc
      deliverables need to produce a first release candidate (and a stable
      branch) before RC1 deadline ($rc1-deadline)

    * Deliverables following cycle-with-intermediary model can release as
      necessary, but in all cases before Final RC deadline ($final-rc-deadline)

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Non-client library freeze: $nclfreeze (R-6 week)
    Client library freeze: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    $SERIES-3 milestone: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    $other-upcoming-event


Week after Milestone-2
======================

#. Review any remaining milestone-2 exceptions

#. Now that we are past MembershipFreeze, we should check if the OpenStack map
   will need to be updated to reflect future final release contents. If any
   changes are needed, those should be proposed in Gerrit as changes to the
   ``openinfra/openstack-map`` repository.

#. Plan the next release cycle schedule based on the number of desired weeks or
   by making sure the cycle ends within a few weeks of the next developer
   event. Using the Monday of the close of the last cycle, and the
   Monday of the planned last week of the new cycle, use the tool
   ``tools/list_weeks.py`` to generate the release schedule YAML file.
   For example::

        ./tools/list_weeks.py t 2019-04-15 2019-10-16

   The generated output can be used to set up the schedule similar to what was
   done for the `Ussuri release <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/679822/>`_.

   .. note::

      Use ``format-yaml doc/source/$series/schedule.yaml`` before pushing
      the patch to gerrit to check consistency.


Between Milestone-2 and Milestone-3
===================================

#. Generate a list of intermediary-released service deliverables that have
   not done a release in this cycle yet. For this, use::

     tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased \
     --model cycle-with-intermediary \
     --type horizon-plugin --type other --type service

   Intermediary-released deliverables that did release only once during
   the last cycle, and have not done a release yet are good candidates to
   switch to the cycle-with-rc model, which is much more suitable for
   deliverables that are only released once per cycle.

   .. note::

      Not every deliverable meeting the above criteria should be encouraged
      to change release model. For example if there are very limited changes
      per cycle, a single release without RCs is probably OK. A team may
      also want to keep the possibility of releasing multiple times per
      cycle.

   Deliverables possibly meeting the criteria should be reviewed during the
   release meeting, and a release model change should be proposed for all
   deliverables where it could make sense. PTLs and release liaisons may
   decide to:

   - immediately release an intermediary release (and -1 the proposed change)
   - confirm the release model change (+1 the proposed change)
   - stay uncertain for this cycle of how many releases will be made, but
     acknowledge that they need to do a release before RC1 (-1 the proposed
     change)

#. Send the following weekly email content::

    General Information
    -------------------

    The following cycle-with-intermediary deliverables have not done any
    intermediary release yet during this cycle. The cycle-with-rc release
    model is more suited for deliverables that plan to be released only once
    per cycle. As a result, we have proposed[1] to change the release model
    for the following deliverables:

    [ list of deliverables ]

    [1] https://review.opendev.org/#/q/topic:$series-cwi

    PTLs and release liaisons for each of those deliverables can either +1
    the release model change, or propose an intermediary release for that
    deliverable. In absence of answer by the end of R-10 week we'll consider
    that the switch to cycle-with-rc is preferable.

    We also published a proposed release schedule for the upcoming
    $nextseries cycle. Please check out the separate thread:

    [ link to thread ]

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Non-client library freeze: $nclfreeze (R-6 week)
    Client library freeze: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    $SERIES-3 milestone: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    $other-upcoming-event


R-8 week
========

#. Make sure the next development series name has been added to the
   ``data/series_status.yaml`` file.

#. Send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We are entering the last weeks of the $series development cycle. From
    now until the final release, we'll send a countdown email like this
    every week.

    It's probably a good time for teams to take stock of their library and
    client work that needs to be completed yet. The non-client library freeze
    is coming up, followed closely by the client lib freeze. Please plan
    accordingly to avoid any last minute rushes to get key functionality in.

    General Information
    -------------------

    Next week is the Extra-AC freeze, in preparation for elections. All
    contributions to OpenStack are valuable, but some are not expressed as
    Gerrit code changes. Please list active contributors to your project team
    who do not have a code contribution this cycle, and therefore won't
    automatically be considered an Active Contributor and allowed
    to vote. This is done by adding extra-acs to
    https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/reference/projects.yaml
    before the Extra-AC freeze on $extraac.

    A quick reminder of the upcoming freeze dates. Those vary depending on
    deliverable type:

    * Oslo libraries are entering feature freeze next week, $extraac.

    * General libraries (except client libraries) need to have their last
    feature release before Non-client library freeze ($nclfreeze). Their
    stable branches are cut early.

    * Client libraries (think python-*client libraries) need to have their
    last feature release before Client library freeze ($milestone3)

    * Deliverables following a cycle-with-rc model (that would be most
    services) observe a Feature freeze on that same date, $milestone3. Any
    feature addition beyond that date should be discussed on the mailing-list
    and get PTL approval. After feature freeze, cycle-with-rc deliverables
    need to produce a first release candidate (and a stable branch) before
    RC1 deadline ($rc1-deadline)

    * Deliverables following cycle-with-intermediary model can release as
    necessary, but in all cases before Final RC deadline ($final-rc-deadline)

    Finally, now is also a good time to start planning what highlights you
    want for your deliverables in the cycle highlights. The deadline to
    submit an initial version for those is set to one week after Feature
    freeze ($highlights).

R-7 week (Extra-AC deadline week)
==================================

#. Notify the Infrastructure team to `generate an artifact signing key`_
   (but not replace the current one yet), and
   begin the attestation process.

   .. _generate an artifact signing key: https://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/signing.html#generation

#. Check with the Technical Committee to make sure Python runtimes have been
   determined for the next development cycle and that Zuul job templates have
   been created to include those runtimes.

   The upcoming release deadlines may include the creation of stable branches.
   When that branching is performed, automated patches will be proposed to the
   master branch of those repos to switch them over to the next cycle's job
   template. If the template is not defined yet, those patches will get a Zuul
   error. A recheck of failed patches will clear that up once the template is
   defined, but it is best if any errors can be avoided to make sure the
   patches get approved in a timely manner.

#. Send the following weekly email content::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    Work on libraries should be wrapping up, in preparation for the various
    library-related deadlines coming up. Now is a good time to make decisions
    on deferring feature work to the next development cycle in order to be
    able to focus on finishing already-started feature work.

    General Information
    -------------------

    We are now getting close to the end of the cycle, and will be gradually
    freezing feature work on the various deliverables that make up the
    OpenStack release.

    This coming week is the deadline for general libraries (except client
    libraries): their last feature release needs to happen before "Non-client
    library freeze" on $nclfreeze. Only bugfixes releases will be allowed
    beyond this point.

    When requesting those library releases, you can also include the
    stable/$series branching request with the review (as an example, see the
    "branches" section here:
    https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables/pike/os-brick.yaml#n2

    In the next weeks we will have deadlines for:

    * Client libraries (think python-*client libraries), which need to have
    their last feature release before "Client library freeze" ($milestone3)

    * Deliverables following a cycle-with-rc model (that would be most
    services), which observe a Feature freeze on that same date, $milestone3.
    Any feature addition beyond that date should be discussed on the
    mailing-list and get PTL approval.

    As we are getting to the point of creating stable/$series branches, this
    would be a good point for teams to review membership in their
    $project-stable-maint groups. Once the stable/$series branches are cut
    for a repo, the ability to approve any necessary backports into those
    branches for $series will be limited to the members of that stable team.
    If there are any questions about stable policy or stable team membership,
    please reach out in the #openstack-stable channel.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Non-client library freeze: $nclfreeze (R-6 week)
    Client library freeze: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    $SERIES-3 milestone: $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    Cycle Highlights Due: $highlight (R-4 week)
    $series final release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-6 week (Final Library Release deadline)
=========================================

#. Propose autoreleases for cycle-with-intermediary libraries (excluding
   client libraries) which had commits that have not been included in a
   release.

   - List them using::

      ./tools/list_library_unreleased_changes.sh > /tmp/cwiff.log

   - Clean the generated list to keep projects names only.

   - Generate the patches by using ``process_auto_releases``::

      ./tools/process_auto_releases.sh $SERIES $(cat /tmp/cwiff.log)

     .. warning::

        ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
        Please use ``$series-final-non-client-libs`` as topic.

   - That patch will be used as a base to communicate with the
     team: if a team wants to wait for a specific patch to make it to the
     library, someone from the team can -1 the patch to have it held, or update
     that patch with a different commit SHA.

     .. note::

      At this point, we want *all* changes in the deliverables, to ensure
      that we have CI configuration up to date when the stable branch
      is created later.

   - Allow the ``stable/$series`` branch to be requested with each library
     final release if they know they are ready. Do not require branching at
     this point in case of critical issues requiring another approved release
     past the freeze date.

   - Between Tuesday and Thursday, merge as soon as possible the patches that
     get +1 from the PTL or the release liaison.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content preparing for R-5 week::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We are getting close to the end of the $series cycle! Next week on
    $milestone3 is the $series-3 milestone, also known as feature freeze.
    It's time to wrap up feature work in the services and their client
    libraries, and defer features that won't make it to the $next-series cycle.

    General Information
    -------------------

    This coming week is the deadline for client libraries: their last feature
    release needs to happen before "Client library freeze" on $milestone3.
    Only bugfix releases will be allowed beyond this point.

    When requesting those library releases, you can also include the
    stable/$series branching request with the review. As an example, see the
    "branches" section here:
    https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/deliverables/pike/os-brick.yaml#n2

    $milestone3 is also the deadline for feature work in all OpenStack
    deliverables following the cycle-with-rc model. To help those projects
    produce a first release candidate in time, only bugfixes should be allowed
    in the master branch beyond this point. Any feature work past that deadline
    has to be raised as a Feature Freeze Exception (FFE) and approved by the
    team PTL.

    Finally, feature freeze is also a good time for submitting a first version
    of your cycle-highlights. Cycle highlights are the raw data that helps shape
    what is communicated in press releases and other release activity at the
    end of the cycle, avoiding direct contacts from marketing folks. See
    https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html#cycle-highlights
    for more details.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    $series-3 milestone (feature freeze): $milestone3 (R-5 week)
    RC1 deadline: $rc1-deadline (R-3 week)
    Final RC deadline: $final-rc-deadline (R-1 week)
    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-5 week (Milestone-3)
======================

#. Process any remaining library freeze exception.

#. Propose autoreleases (``process_auto_releases``) for
   ``cycle-with-intermediary`` client libraries which had commits that have
   not been included in a release.

   - List them using::

      ./tools/list_client_library_unreleased_changes.sh

     .. warning::

        ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
        Please use ``$series-milestone-3`` as topic.

   - That patch will be used as a base
     to communicate with the team: if a team wants to wait for a specific patch
     to make it to the library, someone from the team can -1 the patch to have
     it held, or update that patch with a different commit SHA.

   - Allow the ``stable/$series`` branch to be requested with each client
     library final release if they know they are ready. Do not require
     branching at this point in case of critical issues requiring another
     approved release past the freeze date.

   - Between Tuesday and Thursday, merge as soon as possible the patches that
     get +1 from the PTL or the release liaison.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. Evaluate any non-client libraries that did not have any change merged over the
   cycle to see if it is time to `transition them to the independent release
   model <https://releases.openstack.org/reference/release_models.html#openstack-related-libraries>`__.

   Note: client libraries (and other libraries strongly tied to another
   deliverable) should generally follow their parent deliverable release
   model, even if they did not have a lot of activity themselves).

   If it is OK to transition them, propose to move the deliverable file to
   the ``_independent`` directory.

   If it is not OK to transition them, propose a new minor release and stable
   branch from HEAD.

   A full list of unreleased ``libraries`` and ``client-libraries`` for the cycle
   can be found with::

     tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased --type library --type client-library


#. List cycle-with-intermediary deliverables that have not been released yet::

     tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased \
     --model cycle-with-intermediary \
     --type horizon-plugin --type other --type service

   Send a separate email targeted to teams with such unreleased deliverables
   saying::

    Quick reminder that we'll need a release very soon for a number of
    deliverables following a cycle-with-intermediary release model but which
    have not done *any* release yet in the $series cycle:

    {{list-of-deliverables}}

    Those should be released ASAP, and in all cases before $rc1-deadline, so
    that we have a release to include in the final $series release.

#. On Friday, remind the requirements team to freeze changes to
   ``openstack/requirements`` by applying -2 to all
   open patches. Ensure that reviewers do not approve changes created
   by the proposal bot, but do approve changes for new OpenStack deliverable
   releases.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content for R-4 week.

   Note: String freezes are applied to `I18n team target projects <https://translate.openstack.org/>`_
   and with ``cycle-with-rc`` or ``cycle-with-intermediary`` release model::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We just passed feature freeze! Until release branches are cut, you
    should stop accepting featureful changes to deliverables following the
    cycle-with-rc release model, or to libraries. Exceptions should be
    discussed on separate threads on the mailing-list, and feature freeze
    exceptions approved by the team's PTL.

    Focus should be on finding and fixing release-critical bugs, so that
    release candidates and final versions of the $series deliverables can be
    proposed, well ahead of the final $series release date.

    General Information
    -------------------

    We are still finishing up processing a few release requests, but the
    $series release requirements are now frozen. If new library releases are
    needed to fix release-critical bugs in $series, you must request a
    Requirements Freeze Exception (RFE) from the requirements team before we
    can do a new release to avoid having something released in $series that
    is not actually usable. This is done by posting to the openstack-discuss
    mailing list with a subject line similar to:

            [$PROJECT][requirements] RFE requested for $PROJECT_LIB

    Include justification/reasoning for why a RFE is needed for this lib.
    If/when the requirements team OKs the post-freeze update, we can then
    process a new release.

    A soft String freeze is now in effect, in order to let the I18N team do the
    translation work in good conditions. In Horizon and the various dashboard
    plugins, you should stop accepting changes that modify user-visible
    strings. Exceptions should be discussed on the mailing-list. By
    $rc-final-date this will become a hard string freeze, with no changes
    in user-visible strings allowed.

    Actions
    -------

    stable/$series branches should be created soon for all not-already-branched
    libraries. You should expect 2-3 changes to be proposed for each: a
    .gitreview update, a reno update (skipped for projects not using reno),
    and a tox.ini constraints URL update. Please review those in priority
    so that the branch can be functional ASAP.

    The Prelude section of reno release notes is rendered as the top level
    overview for the release. Any important overall messaging for $series
    changes should be added there to make sure the consumers of your release
    notes see them.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    RC1 deadline: $rc1-deadline (R-3 week)
    Final RC deadline: $final-rc-deadline (R-1 week)
    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-4 week
========

#. Process any remaining client library freeze exception.

#. Early in the week, email openstack-discuss list to remind PTLs that
   cycle-highlights are due this week so that they can be included in
   release marketing preparations.

#. Freeze all cycle-based library releases except for release-critical
   bugs. Independently-released libraries may still be released, but
   constraint or requirement changes will be held until after the freeze
   period.

   .. note::

      Do not release libraries without a link to a message to openstack-discuss
      requesting a requirements RFE and an approval response from that team.

#. Propose ``stable/$series`` branch creation for all client and non-client
   libraries that had not requested it at freeze time.

   - The following command may be used::

      tox -e venv -- propose-library-branches --include-clients

     .. warning::

        Please use ``$series-stable-branches`` as gerrit topic.

   - That patch will be used as a base
     to communicate with the team: if a team wants to wait for a specific patch
     to make it to the library, someone from the team can -1 the patch to have
     it held, or update that patch with a different commit SHA.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. List cycle-with-intermediary deliverables that have not been refreshed in
   the last 2 months. For this, use the following command, with YYYY-MM-DD
   being the day two months ago::

     tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased-since YYYY-MM-DD
     --model cycle-with-intermediary \
     --type horizon-plugin --type other --type service

   Send a separate email targeted to teams with such old deliverables
   saying::

    Quick reminder that for deliverables following the cycle-with-intermediary
    model, the release team will use the latest $series release available on
    release week.

    The following deliverables have done a $series release, but it was not
    refreshed in the last two months:

     {{list_of_deliverables}}

    You should consider making a new one very soon, so that we don't use an
    outdated version for the final release.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content preparing for R-3 week::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    The Release Candidate (RC) deadline is next Thursday, $rc1-deadline. Work
    should be focused on fixing any release-critical bugs.

    General Information
    -------------------

    All deliverables released under a cycle-with-rc model should have a first
    release candidate by the end of the week, from which a stable/$series
    branch will be cut. This branch will track the $series release.

    Once stable/$series has been created, the master branch will be ready to
    switch to $next-series development. While the master branch will no longer
    be feature-frozen, please prioritize any work necessary for completing
    $series plans.  Release-critical bugfixes will need to be merged in the
    master branch first, then backported to the stable/$series branch before
    a new release candidate can be proposed.

    Actions
    -------

    Early in the week, the release team will be proposing RC1 patches for all
    cycle-with-rc projects, using the latest commit from the master branch.
    If your team is ready to go for cutting RC1, please let us know by
    leaving a +1 on these patches.

    If there are still a few more patches needed before RC1, you can -1 the
    patch and update it later in the week with the new commit hash you would
    like to use. Remember, stable/$series branches will be created with this,
    so you will want to make sure you have what you need included to avoid
    needing to backport changes from the master branch (which will
    technically then be $next-series) to this stable branch for any
    additional RCs before the final release.

    The release team will also be proposing releases for any deliverable
    following a cycle-with-intermediary model that has not produced any $series
    release so far.

    Finally, now is a good time to finalize release highlights. Release
    highlights help shape the messaging around the release and make sure that
    your work is properly represented.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    RC1 deadline: $rc1-deadline (R-3 week)
    Final RC deadline: $final-rc-deadline (R-1 week)
    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-3 week (RC1 deadline)
=======================

#. Process any remaining library branching exception.

#. On the Monday, generate release requests for all deliverables
   that have do not have a suitable candidate yet. That includes:

   - Branch ``devstack-plugin-*`` delivrables. Usually devstack plugings are
     branchless and tagless so out of our jurisdiction, however, some are just
     tagless so they are deliverables that must be branched. Please use the
     gerrit topic ``devstack-plugin-$series`` to help to track them. Example
     https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/releases/+/785180

   - cycle-with-intermediary deliverables that have not released yet, for
     which a release should be proposed from HEAD. Stable branch creation
     should be included, unless the deliverable has specified the
     'stable-branch-type: none' option. You can list those using::

       tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --unreleased \
       --model cycle-with-intermediary \
       --type horizon-plugin --type other --type service

     .. note::

        The command lists some deliverables that clearly don't need a release
        (like requirements, release-tests). If there are multiple deliverables
        that require a release, then feel free to use ``process_auto_releases``
        to generate the patches. Please use ``$series-cwi-not-released`` as
        topic.

   - cycle-with-rc that are not trailing deliverables and that have not done
     a RC1 yet, for which a release should be proposed from HEAD, and include
     stable branch creation. You can list those using::

       tools/list_rc1.sh

   - Generate patches by using ``process_auto_releases``.

     .. warning::

        ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
        Please use ``$series-rc1-deadline`` as topic.

   - Those patches will be used as a base to communicate with the team:
     if a team wants to wait for a specific patch to make it to the release,
     someone from the team can -1 the patch to have it held, or update
     that patch with a different commit SHA.

   - Between Tuesday and Thursday, merge as soon as possible the patches that
     get +1 from the PTL or the release liaison.

   - By EOD Thursday, ideally we would want a +1 from the PTL and/or
     release liaison to indicate approval. However we will consider the
     absence of -1 or otherwise negative feedback as an indicator that the
     automatically proposed patches can be approved.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content preparing for R-2 week::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    At this point we should have release candidates (RC1 or recent intermediary
    release) for all the $series deliverables. Teams should be working on any
    release-critical bugs that would require another RC or intermediary release
    before the final release.

    Actions
    -------

    Early in the week, the release team will be proposing stable/$series branch
    creation for all deliverables that have not branched yet, using the latest
    available $series release as the branch point. If your team is ready to go
    for creating that branch, please let us know by leaving a +1 on these
    patches.

    If you would like to wait for another release before branching, you can -1
    the patch and update it later in the week with the new release you would
    like to use. By the end of the week the release team will merge those
    patches though, unless an exception is granted.

    Once stable/$series branches are created, if a release-critical bug is
    detected, you will need to fix the issue in the master branch first, then
    backport the fix to the stable/$series branch before releasing out of the
    stable/$series branch.

    After all of the cycle-with-rc projects have branched we will branch
    devstack, grenade, and the requirements repos. This will effectively open
    them up for $next-series development, though the focus should still be on
    finishing up $series until the final release.

    Opening up the new development cycle is also a good opportunity to teams
    to revise their zuul jobs and used nodesets and clean up all unnecessary
    ones.

    For projects with translations, watch for any translation patches coming
    through and merge them quickly. A new release should be produced so that
    translations are included in the final $series release.

    Finally, now is a good time to finalize release notes. In particular,
    consider adding any relevant "prelude" content. Release notes are
    targetted for the downstream consumers of your project, so it would be
    great to include any useful information for those that are going to pick
    up and use or deploy the $series version of your project.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Final RC deadline: $final-rc-deadline (R-1 week)
    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-2 week
========

#. Process any standing RC1 deadline exceptions.

#. Gracefully release tempest plugins with latest changes available. Tempest
   plugins are branchless however they should be released on their ``HEAD`` at
   the end of each cycle at least
   (cf. `the legacy cycle automatic model <https://releases.openstack.org/reference/release_models.html#cycle-automatic>`_ and
   `the tempest-plugin type <https://releases.openstack.org/reference/deliverable_types.html#tempest-plugin>`_).

   - You can preview unreleased changes by using::

      $ tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --type tempest-plugin
      $ tools/list_unreleased_changes.sh wallaby <tempest-plugin-projects>

   - Process auto release for those who need to be released::

      $ tools/process_auto_releases.sh $series <tempest-plugin-projects-list>

     .. warning::

        Please use ``$series-tp-latest`` as gerrit topic.


#. On the Monday, generate stable branches for all cycle deliverables that
   are still missing one.

   - You can list those using::

         tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --no-stable-branch --cycle-based-no-trailing

     .. warning::

        Please use ``$series-missing-stable-branches`` as gerrit topic.

   - Those patches will be used as a base to communicate with the team:
     if a team wants to wait and make another release before the branch is
     cut, someone from the team can -1 the patch to have it held, or update
     that patch to include another release and stable branch point.

   - Between Tuesday and Thursday, merge as soon as possible the patches that
     get +1 from the PTL or the release liaison.

   - On the Friday, merge patches that did not get any feedback from PTL or
     release liaison. Discuss standing -1s to see if they should be granted
     an exception and wait until next week.

#. After all the projects enabled in devstack by default have been branched,
   we can engage with the QA, I18n and Requirements PTLs to finalize the
   stable branch setup:

   .. note::

      Information about PTLs could be easily retrieved either from the
      `governance project
      <https://opendev.org/openstack/governance/src/branch/master/reference/projects.yaml>`__
      or from the `release project
      <https://opendev.org/openstack/releases/src/branch/master/data/release_liaisons.yaml>`__.

   - At this point all projects should have their branches created,
     as doing the branching first is a prerequisite to allow us to branch
     requirements. You can ensure that all projects are branched by using
     ``tox -e venv -- list-deliverables --no-stable-branch
     --cycle-based-no-trailing`` where a non empty list mean that some
     projects are missing a stable branch and a patch should be proposed to
     create it. The requirements team expect an empty output of this
     command, so you should not continue to the next point until its output
     is empty.

     .. note::

        The previous command will return the `requirements` deliverable
        however in this case this one can be ignored, because our goal is to
        branch it.

   - If the previous list is empty then remind the QA PTL to manage their
     release duties (cf. https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/QA/releases).

     .. note::

        More examples about the QA team's patches during the ussuri cycle are
        available here https://review.opendev.org/#/q/topic:qa-ussuri-release

     .. note::

        As soon as grenade is updated for the new branch (see the RC1
        instructions that follow), projects without stable branches may
        start seeing issues with their grenade jobs because without the
        stable branch the branch selection will cause the jobs to run
        master->master instead of previous->master. At the end of Ocata
        this caused trouble for the Ironic team, for example.

   - Remind the I18n SIG lead to update the translation tools for the new stable
     series.

   - If the previous list is empty then we can remind the requirements
     PTL to propose an update to the deliverable file to create
     the ``stable/$series`` branch for ``openstack/requirements`` and then
     remind to him to announce that the requirements freeze is lifted
     from master.

     .. note::

         We wait until after the other projects have branched to
         create the branch for requirements because tests for the stable
         branches of those projects will fall back to using the master
         branch of requirements until the same stable branch is created,
         but if the branch for the requirements repo exists early the
         changes happening in master on the other projects will not use it
         and we can have divergence between the requirements being tested
         and being declared as correct.

#. Ensure that all projects that are publishing release notes have the
   notes link included in their deliverable file. This is done by running
   the command::

     tools/add_release_note_links.sh $series

   Then submit the updated deliverable files in one patch to update the
   docs.

   Example given: https://review.opendev.org/#/c/723540/

#. Let cycle-with-rc projects iterate on RCs as needed. The final release
   candidate for each project needs to be prepared at least one week before
   the final release date.

   .. note::

      Try to avoid creating more than 3 release candidates so we are not
      creating candidates that consumers are then trained to ignore. Each
      release candidate should be kept for at least 1 day, so if there is a
      proposal to create RCx but clearly a reason to create another one,
      delay RCX to include the additional patches. Teams that know they will
      need additional release candidates can submit the requests and mark
      them WIP until actually ready, so the release team knows that more
      candidates are coming.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content preparing for R-1 week::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We are on the final mile of the $series development cycle!

    Remember that the $series final release will include the latest release
    candidate (for cycle-with-rc deliverables) or the latest intermediary
    release (for cycle-with-intermediary deliverables) available.

    $final-rc-deadline is the deadline for final $series release candidates
    as well as any last cycle-with-intermediary deliverables. We will then
    enter a quiet period until we tag the final release on $release-date.
    Teams should be prioritizing fixing release-critical bugs, before that
    deadline.

    Otherwise it's time to start planning the $next-series development cycle,
    including discussing Forum and PTG sessions content, in preparation of
    $other-upcoming-event.

    Actions
    -------

    Watch for any translation patches coming through on the stable/$series
    branch and merge them quickly. If you discover a release-critical issue,
    please make sure to fix it on the master branch first, then backport the
    bugfix to the stable/$series branch before triggering a new release.

    Please drop by #openstack-release with any questions or concerns about
    the upcoming release !

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event


R-1 week (Final RC deadline)
============================

#. Process any remaining stable branching exception.

#. Notify the documentation
   (Technical Writing SIG - https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation)
   team that it should be safe to apply
   their process to create the new release series landing pages for
   docs.openstack.org. Their process works better if they wait until
   most of the projects have their stable branches created, but they
   can do the work before the final release date to avoid having to
   synchronize with the release team on that day.

#. On the day before the deadline for final release candidates,
   propose last-minute RCs where needed:

   - Check the list of unreleased changes for cycle-with-rc projects, by
     running the following command in the releases repo working directory::

     $ ./tools/list_rc_updates.sh

   - Propose patches creating a new RC for those that have unreleased
     bugfixes or updated translations. Generate patches by using
     ``process_auto_releases``.

     .. warning::

        ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
        Please use ``$series-final-rc`` as topic.

   - Patches that get a +1 from PTL or release liaison should be approved.
     A -1 will mean that the PTL prefers to wait for a post-release stable
     update. Patches that get no feedback by the deadline should be abandoned.

#. At the end of the week, send weekly email content preparing for R-0 week::

    Development Focus
    -----------------

    We will be releasing the coordinated OpenStack $series release next week,
    on $release-date. Thanks to everyone involved in the $series cycle!

    We are now in pre-release freeze, so no new deliverable will be created
    until final release, unless a release-critical regression is spotted.

    Otherwise, teams attending the PTG in $ptg-location should start to plan
    what they will be discussing there, by creating and filling team etherpads.
    You can access the list of PTG etherpads at:

    http://ptg.openstack.org/etherpads.html

    General Information
    -------------------

    On release day, the release team will produce final versions of
    deliverables following the cycle-with-rc release model, by re-tagging
    the commit used for the last RC.

    A patch doing just that will be proposed. PTLs and release liaisons should
    watch for that final release patch from the release team. While not
    required, we would appreciate having an ack from each team before we
    approve it on the 16th, so that their approval is included in the metadata
    that goes onto the signed tag.

    Upcoming Deadlines & Dates
    --------------------------

    Final $SERIES release: $release-date
    $other-upcoming-event

#. After the email is sent, use ``propose-final-releases`` to tag the
   existing most recent release candidates as the final release for
   projects using the cycle-with-rc model.


R+0 week (Final Release)
========================

#. We are in pre-release freeze. Only release-critical regressions, or
   legal compliance issues, or bugs making it otherwise impossible to install
   and use the software on release day, should be considered by the release
   management team for a pre-release freeze exception. If approved,
   release freeze exceptions should trigger the production of a new RC (or
   cycle-with-intermediary release) and (if needed) a regeneration of the
   final release patch.

#. On release day freeze all other release activity by holding stable branch
   releases while coordinated release is underway.

#. Few hours before approving the release patch ensure that all the available
   release note landing pages are present
   (example: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/releases/+/786374)::

      tools/add_release_note_links.sh $SERIES

#. On release day, approve the final release patch created earlier. Before
   merging the patch ensure that used infras are operational, you can do that
   by looking at https://status.python.org/ and by asking to our infra team
   how is the situation of the openstack infra.

   .. note::

      This needs to happen several hours before the press release
      from the foundation (to give us time to handle failures) but not
      too far in advance (to avoid releasing the day before the press
      release).

#. Once the final patch is proceesed, run the ``missing-releases`` script
   to check for missing tarballs on the release page before the announcement::

      tox -e venv -- missing-releases --series $SERIES

   If there are any missing deliverables, fix them.

   .. warning::

      ``process_auto_releases`` will ask you to enter a topic for the patches.
      Please use ``$series-final-missing-deliverables`` as topic.

#. Mark series as released on releases.o.o, by updating
   ``doc/source/$series/index.rst``, ``data\series_status.yaml``,  and
   changing the default series in ``openstack_releases/default.py``..

   See https://review.opendev.org/#/c/727746 for an example.

   .. note::

      This item can be staged as a patch on top of the final release patch.

      The ``next-phase`` date should be set to the first Monday after the
      period declared for the Maintained phase.
      See https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html#maintenance-phases

#. Send release announcement email to
   ``openstack-announce@lists.openstack.org``, based on
   ``templates/final.txt``. Coordinate the timing of the email with
   the press release from the Foundation staff.

#. Send an email to the openstack-discuss list to point to the official
   release announcement from the previous step, and declare
   ``openstack/releases`` unfrozen for releases on the new series.
