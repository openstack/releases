cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Block Storage API microversions 3.63 and 3.64 add useful information to
    the volume detail response (``volume_type_id`` and ``encryption_key_id``,
    respectively).
  - |
    Added new backend drivers: Ceph iSCSI, Dell EMC PowerVault ME, KIOXIA
    Kumoscale, Open-E JovianDSS, and TOYOU ACS5000. Additionally, many current
    drivers have added support for features exceeding the required driver
    functions, with revert to snapshot and backend QoS being particularly
    popular this cycle.
  - |
    Added a new backup driver for S3-compatible storage.
