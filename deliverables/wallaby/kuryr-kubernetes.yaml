cycle-highlights:
  - Nested mode with nodes VMs running in multiple subnets is now available.
    To use that functionality a new option `[pod_vif_nested]worker_nodes_subnets`
    is introduced accepting multiple Subnet IDs.
  - Kuryr now handles Services that do not define the `.spec.selector`,
    allowing the user to manually manage the Endpoints object.
  - Kuryr can handle egress Network Policy that allows traffic to Pods
    being pointed by a Service without Selector.
  - Added support for SCTP.
  - Networks can now be created by relying on the default MTU defined
    in Neutron, regardless of the SDN used and without changing the
    default configuration value in Kuryr.
