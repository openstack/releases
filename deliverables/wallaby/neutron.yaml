cycle-highlights:
  - New subnet type ``network:routed`` is now available. IPs of such
    subnet can be advertized with BGP over a provider network. This
    basically achieves a BGP-to-the-rack feature, where the L2 connectivity
    can be confined to a rack only, and all external routing is done
    by the switches, using BGP. In this mode, it is still possible to
    use VXLAN connectivity between the compute nodes, and only floating
    IPs and router gateways are using BGP routing.
  - A port already bound with a QoS minimum_bandwidth rule can now be
    updated with a new QoS policy with a minimum_bandwidth rule. It
    will change the allocations in placement as well.
  - A new vnic type ``vdpa`` has been added to allow requesting port
    that utilize a vHost-vDPA offload. It is supported by ML2/OVS and
    ML2/OVN mech drivers currently.
  - Deletion of the ML2/OVN agents is now supported.
  - New resource ``address-groups`` can be used in the ``security group
    rules`` to add group of the IP addresses to the rule.
