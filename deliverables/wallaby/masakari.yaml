cycle-highlights:
  - Support for disabling and enabling failover segments. This way operators
    are able to put whole segments into maintenance mode instead of
    having to do it for each single host.
  - Support for smoothing-out the decision about whether to consider
    a host down or not. Operators can configure host monitors to consider
    a chosen number of probes before sending the notification about
    host being down.
  - Support for running host monitors in environments without systemd,
    such as app containers.
  - Support for using system-scoped tokens when contacting Nova.
