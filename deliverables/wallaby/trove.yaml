cycle-highlights:
  - Support image tags for the datastore version. When using image tags,
    Trove is able to get the image dynamically from Glance for creating
    instances.
  - Added custom container registry configuration for trove guest agent,
    it's now possible to use images in private registry rather than
    docker hub.
  - Added a new field ``operating_status`` for the instance to show
    the actual operational status of user's database.
  - In multi-region deployment with geo-replicated Swift, the user can
    restore a backup in one region by manually specifying the original
    backup data location created in another region.
