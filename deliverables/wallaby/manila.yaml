cycle-highlights:
  - OSProfiler support has been added for tracing and observability.
  - Users may now add and update security services on share networks that
    are in use.
  - Operators may now set maximum and minimum share sizes as extra
    specifications on share types. It is also possible to limit the maximum
    size of shares via project and share type quotas.
  - The number and size of shares can be limited on share servers for load
    balancing.
  - The service provided default RBAC policies for all API endpoints have
    been adjusted to accommodate system scoped and project scoped personas
    with admin, member and reader roles where appropriate.
  - The service now supports a healthcheck middleware that is enabled by
    default.
  - Several driver improvements have been committed. The Container share driver
    now supports user defined LDAP security services that can be added to
    share networks or modified at any time. The NetApp driver supports
    setting up FPolicy events on shares. It also now allows users to
    add/update Kerberos, LDAP or Active Directory security services on their
    share networks at any time. The CephFS driver has been refactored to
    interact with the ceph manager daemon to create and manage shares. It
    also supports efficiently cloning snapshots into new shares.
  - A new share driver has been added for Zadara Cloud Storage and supports
    NFS and CIFS protocols.
