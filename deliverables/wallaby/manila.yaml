cycle-highlights:
  - OSProfiler support has been added for tracing and observability.
  - Users may now add and update security services on share networks
    that are in use.
  - Operators may now set maximum and minimum share sizes as extra specifications
    on share types. It is also possible to limit the maximum size of
    shares via project and share type quotas.
  - The number and size of shares can be limited on share servers for
    load balancing.
  - The service provided default RBAC policies for all API endpoints
    have been adjusted to accommodate system scoped and project scoped
    personas with admin, member and reader roles where appropriate.
  - The service now supports a healthcheck middleware that is enabled
    by default.
  - Several driver improvements have been committed. The Container share
    driver now supports user defined LDAP security services that can
    be added to share networks or modified at any time. The NetApp driver
    supports setting up FPolicy events on shares. It also now allows
    users to add/update Kerberos, LDAP or Active Directory security
    services on their share networks at any time. The CephFS driver
    has been refactored to interact with the ceph manager daemon to
    create and manage shares. It also supports efficiently cloning snapshots
    into new shares.
  - A new share driver has been added for Zadara Cloud Storage and supports
    NFS and CIFS protocols.
