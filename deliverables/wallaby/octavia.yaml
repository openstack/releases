cycle-highlights:
  - With the addition of ALPN and HTTP/2 support for backend pool members,
    Octavia now supports the gRPC protocol. gRPC enables bidirectional
    streaming of Protocol Buffer messages through the load balancer.
  - Octavia now supports Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
    load balancing. The addition of SCTP enables new mobile, telephony,
    and multimedia use cases for Octavia.
  - Load balancers using the amphora provider will benefit from increased
    performance and scalability when using amphora images built with
    version 2.x of the HAProxy load balancing engine.
  - Amphora instances are now supported on AArch64/ARM64 based instances.
  - Octavia now supports the Keystone default roles and scoped tokens.
