cycle-highlights:
  - Horizon supports the registered default policies. Now operators
    do not need to define all the policies in the policy file instead
    define only those policy they would like to override.
  - Chinese locales ``zh-cn`` and ``zh-tw`` have been changed to ``zh-hans``
    and ``zh-hant`` respectively following the change in Django because
    the new locales decouple what is spoken from specific locations
    as they are also used outside of China.
  - Added Volume backups support for admin.
