cycle-highlights:
  - All images, scripts and Ansible playbooks now use Python 3, and
    support for Python 2 has been dropped.
  - Added support for CentOS 8 hosts and images.
  - Added initial support for TLS encryption of backend API services,
    providing end-to-end encryption of API traffic. Currently Barbican,
    Cinder, Glance, Heat, Horizon, Keystone, Nova and Placement are
    supported.
  - Added support for deployment of Open Virtual Network (OVN) and integration
    of it with Neutron.
  - Added support for deployment of Zun CNI (Container Networking Interface)
    components allowing Docker with containerd to support Zun capsules
    (pods).
  - Added support for Elasticsearch Curator to help manage clustered
    log data.
  - Added components necessary to use Mellanox networking devices with
    Neutron.
  - Streamlined configuration of external Ceph integration, making it
    easy to go from Ceph-Ansible-deployed Ceph cluster to enabling it
    in OpenStack.
