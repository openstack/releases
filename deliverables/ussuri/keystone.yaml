cycle-highlights:
  - The user experience for creating application credentials and trusts
    has been greatly improved when using a federated authentication
    method. Federated users whose role assignments come from mapped
    group membership will have those group memberships persisted for
    a configurable TTL after their token expires, during which time
    their application credentials will remain valid.
  - Keystone to Keystone assertions now contain the user's group memberships
    on the keystone Identity Provider which can be mapped to group membership
    on the keystone Service Provider.
  - Federated users can now be given concrete role assignments without
    relying on the mapping API by allowing federated users to be created
    directly in keystone and linked to their Identity Provider.
  - When bootstrapping a new keystone deployment, the admin role now
    defaults to having the "immutable" option set, which prevents it
    from being accidentally deleted or modified unless the "immutable"
    option is deliberately removed.
  - Keystonemiddleware no longer supports the Identity v2.0 API, which
    was removed from keystone in previous release cycles.
