    maintenance perspective including deprecations of old features,
    cleanup of deprecated features, integration test coverage improvements,
    migration to mock usage in unit tests and so on.

    Horizon and all horizon plugins now support Django 2.2 which is
    the only supported LTS of Django. Django is a framework which horizon
    depends on. Note that python 2.7 is no longer supported and
    we have enter into the python3 era.

    A couple of feature gaps in keystone support are implemented:
    a feature to allow users to change expired password including first login,
    password lock option in the user panel, and
    a support of access rules for application credentials.
