cycle-highlights:
  - Octavia now supports deploying load balancers in specific availability
    zones. This allows the deployment of load balancing capabilities
    to edge environments.
  - The Octavia amphora driver has added a technology preview feature
    that improves control plane resiliency. Should a control plane host
    go down during a load balancer provisioning operation, an alternate
    controller can resume the in-process provisioning and complete the
    request.
  - Users can now specify the TLS ciphers acceptable for listeners and
    pools. This allows load balancers to enforce security compliance
    requirements.
