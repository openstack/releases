cycle-highlights:
  - Support Helm v3 to install all magnum installed charts. Support
    for Helm v2 client will be removed in X release.
  - A new config option ``post_install_manifest_url`` is added to support
    installing cloud provider/vendor specific manifest after deploying
    a kuberbetes cluster.
  - A new ``--merge-labels`` boolean flag can be used to merge user
    labels at cluster/nodegroup scope with cluster template/cluster
    labels.
  - Cloud admin users now can do rolling upgrade on behalf of end users
    to do urgent security patching.
  - Magnum now cascade deletes all the load balancers before deleting
    the cluster, not only including load balancers for the cluster services
    and ingresses, but also those for Kubernetes API/etcd endpoints.
  - Magnum supports updating the k8s cluster health status via the Magnum
    cluster update API so that a controller (e.g. magnum-auto-healer)
    running inside the k8s cluster can call the Magnum update API to
    update the cluster health status.
