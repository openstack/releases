cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Users can now launch instances with accelerators managed by
    Cyborg, as the `Nova-Cyborg integration
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/ussuri/approved/nova-cyborg-interaction.html>`_
    has been completed. See `accelerator operation guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/accelerator-support.html>`_
    to find which instance operations are supported.
  - |
    New APIs have been implemented to list devices managed by Cyborg
    and, in general, to view and manage inventory of accelerators.
  - |
    Cyborg has laid the foundations for providing backwards compatibility
    in future releases by adopting microversions in v2 API.
  - |
    The Cyborg client is now based on OpenStack SDK and supports
    most Version 2 APIs.
  - |
    Improved quality overall by adding more unit/functional tests and by
    reducing technical debt.
