cycle-highlights:
  - The ``OVN`` driver is now merged into Neutron repository and is
    one of the in-tree Neutron ML2 drivers, like ``linuxbridge`` or
    ``openvswitch``. ``OVN`` driver benefits over the ``openvswitch``
    driver include for example DVR with distributed SNAT traffic, distributed
    DHCP and possibility to run without network nodes. Other ML2 drivers
    are still in-tree and are fully supported. Currently default agent
    is still ``openvswitch`` but our plan is to make ``OVN`` driver
    to be the default choice in the future.
  - Support for stateless security groups has been added. Users can
    now create security group set as ``stateless`` which means that
    conntrack will not be used for any rule in that group. One port
    can only use ``stateless`` or ``stateful`` security groups. In some
    use cases stateless security groups will allow operator to choose
    for optimized datapath performance whereas stateful security groups
    impose extra processing on the system.
  - Role Based Access Control (``RBAC``) for address scopes and subnet
    pools has been added. Address scopes and subnet pools are usually
    defined by operators and exposed to users. This change allows operators
    to use more granular access controls on address scopes and subnet
    pools.
  - Support for tagging resources during creation has been added in
    Neutron API. User can now set tags for resources like e.g. ports
    directly in ``POST`` requests. This will improve the performance
    of kubernetes network operations a lot. The number of API calls
    which e.g. ``Kuryr`` has to send to Neutron are greatly reduced.
