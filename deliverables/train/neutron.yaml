cycle-highlights:
  - When different subnet pools participate in the same address scope,
    the constraints disallowing subnets to be allocated from different
    pools on the same network have been relaxed. As long as subnet pools
    participate in the same address scope, subnets can now be created
    from different subnet pools when multiple subnets are created on
    a network. When address scopes are not used, subnets with the same
    ``ip_version`` on the same network must still be allocated from
    the same subnet pool.
  - A new API, extraroute-atomic, has been implemented for Neutron routers.
    This extension enables users to add or delete individual entries
    to a router routing table, instead of having to update the entire
    table as one whole
  - Support for L3 conntrack helpers has been added. Users can now configure
    conntrack helper target rules to be set for a router. This is accomplished
    by associating a conntrack_helper sub-resource to a router.
