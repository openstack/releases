cycle-highlights:
  - A v2 API, along with five new endpoints has been introduced. It
    is marked as ``EXPERIMENTAL`` for now. Its endpoints support timezones,
    and aim at being more generic and efficient than v1 endpoints.
  - A Prometheus scope fetcher has been added. It allows dynamic scope
    discovery from Prometheus and is intended to be used with the Prometheus
    collector.
  - Fault-tolerance and performance of the processor has been improved.
    Each processor does now spawn several workers, which are restarted
    in case of a failure.
  - A v2 storage driver for Elasticsearch has been introduced. It is
    marked as ``EXPERIMENTAL`` for now.
