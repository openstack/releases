cycle-highlights:
  - An Access Control List (ACL) can now be applied to the load balancer
    listener. Each port can have a list of allowed source addresses.
  - Octavia now supports Amphora log offloading. Operators can define
    syslog targets for the Amphora administrative logs and for the tenant
    load balancer connection logs.
  - Amphorae can now be booted using Cinder volumes.
  - The Amphora images have been optimized to reduce the image size
    and memory consumption.
