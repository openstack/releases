cycle-highlights:
  - A lot of improvements have been made for the Service Tenant Deployment
    model which is highly recommended in the production environment.
    The cloud administrator is allowed to define the management resources
    for the trove instance, such as keypair, security group, network,
    etc.
  - Creating trove guest image becomes much easier for the cloud administrator
    or developer by using ``trovestack`` script.
  - Users could expose the trove instance to the public with the ability
    to limit source IP addresses access to the database.
