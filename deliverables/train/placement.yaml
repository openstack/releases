cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Train is the first cycle where Placement is available solely from its own
    project and must be installed separately from Nova.
  - |
    Extensive benchmarking and profiling have led to massive performance
    enhancements in the placement service, especially in environments with
    large numbers of resource providers and high concurrency.
  - |
    Added support for forbidden aggregates which allows groups of resource
    providers to only be used for specific purposes, such as reserving a group
    of compute nodes for licensed workloads.
  - |
    Added a suite of features which, combined, enable targeting candidate
    providers that have complex trees modeling NUMA layouts, multiple devices,
    and networks where affinity between and grouping among the members of the
    tree are required. These features will help to enable NFV and other high
    performance workloads in the cloud.
