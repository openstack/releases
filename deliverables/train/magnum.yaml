cycle-highlights:
  - Fedora CoreOS driver is now available which we are please to offer
    since Fedora Atomic will be end of life at the end of this November.
    We welcome users to test and provide feedback for this driver.
  - Node groups now allow users to create clusters with groups of nodes
    with different specs, e.g. GPU node groups and high memory node
    groups. Thanks for the great work from CERN team and StackHPC.
  - Rolling upgrade is available for both Kubernetes version and the
    node operating system with minimal downtime.
  - Auto healing can be deployed on Kubernetes cluster to monitor the
    cluster health and replace broken nodes when failure is detected.
  - Boot Kubernetes cluster from volumes and configurable volume types.
    They can even set the volume type etcd volumes. This may be useful
    for cloud providers who want to use SSDs, NVMEs, etc.
  - Private cluster can be created following best security practices,
    isolating Kubernetes clusters from Internet access. This may be
    a desirable feature for enterprise users. Now they have the flexibility
    to choose between a private cluster by default and only allow access
    to the API exposed on Internet or make it fully accessible.
  - Add ``cinder_csi_enabled`` label to support out of tree Cinder CSI.
  - Support ``containerd`` as a ``container_runtime`` as an alternative to
    ``host-docker``.
  - A new config ``health_polling_interval`` is supported to make the interval
    configurable or disable completely.
