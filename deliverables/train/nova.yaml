cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Live migration support for servers with a
    `NUMA topology, pinned CPUs <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/cpu-topologies.html>`_
    and/or `huge pages <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/huge-pages.html>`_,
    when using the libvirt compute driver.
  - |
    Live migration support for servers with
    `SR-IOV ports <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-sriov>`_
    attached when using the libvirt compute driver.
  - |
    Support for cold migrating and resizing servers with bandwidth-aware
    `Quality of Service ports <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/port_with_resource_request.html>`_
    attached.
  - |
    Improvements to the scheduler for more intelligently filtering
    `results from the Placement service <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/schedulers.html#prefiltering>`_.
  - |
    Improved multi-cell resilience with the ability to
    `count quota usage <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/quotas.html#quota-usage-from-placement>`_
    using the Placement service and API database.
  - |
    A new framework supporting hardware-based encryption of guest memory
    to protect users against attackers or rogue administrators snooping on
    their workloads when using the libvirt compute driver. Currently only has
    basic support for
    `AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/hypervisor-kvm.html#amd-sev-secure-encrypted-virtualization>`_.
  - |
    `API improvements <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/api-microversion-history.html>`_
    for both administrators/operators and end users.
  - |
    Improved `operational tooling <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html>`_
    for things like archiving the database and healing instance resource
    allocations in Placement.
  - |
    Improved coordination with the baremetal service during external node
    `power cycles <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/power-sync.html>`_.
  - |
    Support for
    `VPMEM (Virtual Persistent Memory) <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/train/approved/virtual-persistent-memory.html>`_
    when using the libvirt compute driver. This provides data persistence
    across power cycles at a lower cost and with much larger capacities than
    DRAM, especially benefitting HPC and memory databases such as redis,
    rocksdb, oracle, SAP HANA, and Aerospike.
