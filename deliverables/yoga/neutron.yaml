cycle-highlights:
  - Local IP - a virtual IP which can be shared across multiple ports
    or VMs is now available. Local IP is guaranteed to only be reachable
    within the same physical server or node boundaries.
  - Add support for VNIC type remote-managed to support port binding
    to SmartNIC DPUs. SmartNIC DPU portbinding requires OVN version
    21.12 or above, compiled with OVN VIF version 21.12 or above.
  - Support for minimum packet processing based scheduling. With this
    feature, Nova instances can be scheduled to compute hosts that will
    honor the minimum pps requirements of the instance as defined by
    QoS policies of its ports.
