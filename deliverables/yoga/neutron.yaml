cycle-highlights:
  - Local IP - a virtual IP which can be shared across multiple ports or VMs
    is now available. Local IP is guaranteed to only be reachable within the
    same physical server or node boundaries.
  - Add support for VNIC type remote-managed to support port binding to
    SmartNIC DPUs. SmartNIC DPU portbinding requires OVN version 21.12 or
    above, compiled with OVN VIF version 21.12 or above.
  - Support for minimum packet processing based scheduling. With this feature,
    Nova instances can be scheduled to compute hosts that will honor the
    minimum pps requirements of the instance as defined by QoS policies of its
    ports.
