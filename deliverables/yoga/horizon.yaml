cycle-highlights:
  - Horizon added experimental support of System Scope. There is a new
    entry System Scope added in context switcher menu which allows users
    to switch to a system scope token so operations that require this
    kind of token can be performed. It is disabled by default in the
    Yoga release.
  - Users can now perform Qos Rules CRUD operations to the Network QoS
    Policy using horizon.
