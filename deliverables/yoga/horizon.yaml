cycle-highlights:
  - Horizon added experimental support of System Scope. There is a
    new entry System Scope added in context switcher menu which
    allows users to switch to a system scope token so operations
    that require this kind of token can be performed. It is disabled
    by default in the Yoga release.
  - Users can now perform Qos Rules CRUD operations to the Network QoS
    Policy using horizon.
