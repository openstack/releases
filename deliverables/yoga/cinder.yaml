    Block Storage API microversion 3.68 adds the ability for users
    to request that a volume be re-imaged.  It has always been possible
    in Block Storage API version 3 to create a bootable volume by
    requesting that image data from the Image service be written to the
    volume when the volume was created; now it's possible to do this to
    an existing volume.
  - |
    The Block Storage API no longer requires that request URLs contain
    a project ID.  This makes the API more consistent with other
    OpenStack APIs.  For backward compatibility, legacy URLs containing
    a project ID continue to be recognized.
  - |
    New backend drivers were added: Lightbits LightOS for NVMe/TCP, a
    TOYOU NetStor Fibre Channel driver, and NEC V Series Storage drivers
    (FC and iSCSI).
  - |
    Current backend storage drivers have added support for features
    exceeding the required driver functions, for example, Active/Active
    replication.
