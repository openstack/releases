cycle-highlights:
  - |
    The usage of oslo.rootwrap is being deprecated in favor of oslo.privsep
    in places where manila's micro services need elevated privileges to execute
    actions on the host. The LVM share back end driver now uses privsep
    dropping the need for a number of rootwrap entries.
  - |
    Shares can now be soft-deleted into a recycle bin where they can stay
    for a configurable amount of time before being purged. While they're in
    the recycle bin, they can be viewed and restored on demand.
  - |
    Cloud administrators can now direct provisioning of shares and replicas to
    specific hosts via scheduler hints
  - |
    Users may now specify more than one subnet on their share networks
    across any availability zone. This allows scaling the networks on the NAS
    servers that export their shared file systems.
