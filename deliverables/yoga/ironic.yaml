cycle-highlights:
  - The default deployment boot mode changed from `Legacy BIOS` to `UEFI`.
  - Booting final instances via network (as opposed to via a local bootloader)
    is now deprecated, except for the cases of booting from volume or
    the ramdisk deploy interface.
  - New parameter `image_type` in `instance_info` field, used to distinguish
    between partition and whole disk images instead of `kernel/ramdisk`
    pair.
