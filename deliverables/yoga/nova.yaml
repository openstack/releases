cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Nova provides work-in-progress support for Keystone's `unified limits
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/unified-limits.html>`_
    in  order to allow operators to test this feature in non-production
    systems so we can collect early feedback about performance.
  - |
    Nova `now implements
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/policy-concepts.html#nova-supported-scope-roles>`_
    the scope concept and default system and project roles provided by
    Keystone. This feature isn't yet enabled by default but operators are
    encouraged to start using it before we switch from the legacy roles
    in a next release.
  - |
    Support is added for network backends that leverage SmartNICs to
    `offload the controlplane from the host server
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/networking.html#sr-iov>`_.
    This enables increased security by removing the control plane from the
    host server and reduced overhead by leveraging the cpu and ram resources
    on modern SmartNIC DPUs.
  - |
    Nova now provides AArch64, PPC64LE, MIPs, and s390x
    `emulated architecture support
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/hw-emulation-architecture.html>`_
    independent of the host architecture. Please note this feature isn't fully
    tested in our upstream CI so support should be considered experimental.
