cycle-highlights:
  - Some enhancements were made to the vault back-end.  It is now possible
    to specify a KV mountpoint and use AppRoles to manage authentication.
  - We now run a Barbican specific Octavia gate to verify the Octavia
    load balancing scenario.
  - The PKCS#11 plugin was modified to allow the hmac_keywrap_mechanism
    to be configured.  With this change, Barbican can be deployed with
    Ultimaco HSMs.
  - It is now possible to deploy Barbican with the pkcs#11 backend using
    either a Thales or an ATOS HSM via TripleO.
  - Fixes were made to ensure that the barbican-manage commands for
    key rotation worked for the PKCS#11 plugin.
