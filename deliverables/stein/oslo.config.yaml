cycle-highlights:
  - Added a Castellan config driver that allows secrets to be moved
    from on-disk config files to any Castellan-compatible keystore.
    This driver lives in the Castellan project, so Castellan must be
    installed in order to use it.
  - Added a config driver to read values from environment variables,
    which allows configuration of services in containers without needing
    to inject a file. This driver is enabled by default in oslo.config.
  - Added a config validation tool, ``oslo-config-validator``. This
    uses the oslo-config-generator data to find options in a config
    file that are not defined in the service.
