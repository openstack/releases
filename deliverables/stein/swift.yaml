cycle-highlights:
  - Numerous improvements to the S3 API compatibility layer.
  - Several fixes and improvements for the data-encryption middleware,
    including allowing multiple keymaster middlewares. This allows migration
    from one key provider to another.
  - Operators have more control over account and container server background
    daemon I/O usage with the new ``databases_per_second`` config option.
  - Erasure-coded data may now be rebuilt to handoff nodes. This improves
    data durability when disk failures go unremedied for extended periods.
