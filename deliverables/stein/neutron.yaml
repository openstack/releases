cycle-highlights:
  - Support for strict minimum bandwidth based scheduling. With this
    feature, Nova instances can be scheduled to compute hosts that will
    honor the minimum bandwidth requirements of the instance as defined
    by QoS policies of its ports.
  - Network Segment Range Management. This features enables cloud administrators
    to manage network segment ranges dynamically via a new API extension,
    as opposed to the previous approach of editing configuration files.
    This feature targets StarlingX and edge use cases, where ease of
    of management is paramount.
  - Speed up Neutron port bulk creation. The targets are containers
    / k8s use cases, where ports are created in groups.
  - (FWaaS) FWaaS v1 has been removed. FWaaS v2 is available since Newton
    release and it covers all features in FWaaS v1. A migartion script
    is provided to convert existing FWaaS v1 objects into FWaaS v2 models.
