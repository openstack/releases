cycle-highlights:
  - Improved performance so that Senlin operations execute multiple
    orders of magnitude faster.
  - Health policy v1.1 now allows a user to specify multiple types of
    detection modes.
  - Senlin APIs now issues synchronous failures in case of cluster/node
    lock, cooldown in effect or action conflict.
  - Operators can now remove completed actions using action-purge subcommand
    in senlin-manage tool.  This is useful for long-running clusters
    that have accumulated a large number of actions in the database.
