cycle-highlights:
  - It is now possible to run Nova with version 1.0.0 of the recently
    extracted placement service, hosted from its own repository. Note
    that install/upgrade of an extracted placement service is not yet
    fully implemented in all deployment tools. Operators should check
    with their particular deployment tool for support before proceeding.
    See the placement `install <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/install/index.html>`_
    and `upgrade <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/upgrade/to-stein.html>`_
    documentation for more details. In Stein, operators may choose to
    continue to run with the integrated placement service from the Nova
    repository, but should begin planning a migration to the extracted
    placement service by Train, as the removal of the integrated placement
    code from Nova is planned for the Train release.
  - Users can now specify a volume type when creating servers.
  - The compute API is now tolerant of transient conditions in a deployment
    like partial infrastructure failures, for example a cell not being
    reachable.
  - Users can now create servers with Neutron ports that have quality-of-service
    minimum bandwidth rules.
  - Operators can now set overcommit allocation ratios using Nova configuration
    files or the placement API.
  - Compute driver capabilities are now automatically exposed as traits
    in the placement API so they can be used for scheduling via flavor
    extra specs and/or image properties.
  - Live migration is now supported for the VMware driver.
