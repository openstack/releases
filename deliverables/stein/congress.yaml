    name: stable/stein
cycle-highlights:
  - Important new NFV fault management capabilities through the addition
    of multiple new features in Congress integration with Nova, Tacker,
    and Monasca.
  - The new JGress framework unlocks whole new classes of policy use
    by making the state of the cloud as given by JSON APIs available
    for policy evaluation. By adopting a JSON query language for expressing
    policy directly over JSON API data, JGress enables deployers to
    plug-in new data sources without being limited by the availability
    of integration drivers.
  - As with every release, we continue to make Congress more robust
    and stable than ever with bug fixes and internal improvements.
