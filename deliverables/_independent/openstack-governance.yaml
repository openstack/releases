# Governance is a dependency of openstack/releases itself. This may create
# an issue should governance become uninstallable, as we won't be able to
# use openstack/releases to release a fixed version.
# Should this situation ever occur again, the proper way to fix it is to
# push a tag to governance manually, then retroactively submit the
# corresponding change to openstack/releases. The change will update the
# metadata while otherwise being a noop.
