  - Octavia load balancers now support multiple VIPs, these VIPs must be
    allocated on subnets from the same network, enabling dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6)
    load balancers.
  - Notification support is available in Octavia, it sends notifications about
    major events of the life-cycle of a load balancer.
  - Octavia implements a failover circuit breaker, an optional feature that
    prevents Octavia from automatically recreating Amphorae virtual machines
    during cloud outages.
