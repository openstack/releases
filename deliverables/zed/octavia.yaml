  - Octavia load balancers now support multiple VIPs, these VIPs must
    be allocated on subnets from the same network, enabling dual-stack
    (IPv4/IPv6) load balancers.
  - Notification support is available in Octavia, it sends notifications
    about major events of the life-cycle of a load balancer.
  - Octavia implements a failover circuit breaker, an optional feature
    that prevents Octavia from automatically recreating Amphorae virtual
    machines during cloud outages.
