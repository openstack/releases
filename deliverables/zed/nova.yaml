    and using the libvirt driver.

    All lifecycle actions are now fully supported for
    `instances with vDPA ports <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/vdpa.html>`_
    , including vDPA hot-plug live migration, suspend and attach/detach.

    Visible API improvements include :
     the possibility to rebuild a volume-backed instance;
     the ability to unshelve an instance to a specific host (admin only);
     the change to only accept importing a public key but also with an extended
     name pattern;
     Nova policies removing system scopes for all APIs hence finishing to
