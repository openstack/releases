cycle-highlights:
  - Support for the `syslinux <https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Syslinux_6_Changelog#Changes_in_6.04>`_
    and the often separately packaged `isolinux <https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=ISOLINUX>`_
    and `pxelinux <https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=PXELINUX>`_
    are deprecated.
  - The deprecated support for instance network booting (not to be confused
    with the ramdisk deploy, iSCSI boot or Anaconda deploy) has been
    removed. The `boot_option` capability is no longer supported.
  - Ironic can automatically provide an instance requestorâ€™s project,
    `lessee` rights to the Bare Metal machine under the Role Based Access
    Control model. This feature, is normally disabled, but can be enabled
    using the `[conductor]automatic_lessee` configuration option.
