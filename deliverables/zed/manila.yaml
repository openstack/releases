cycle-highlights:
  - Manila reached feature parity between the native client and OSC.
    You can use the ``openstack share ..`` command line interface to
    administer the Shared File System service (manila) on any deployment
    alongside using it to provision and manage the life cycle of manila
    resources. Refer to the `official documentation <https://docs.openstack
    .org/python-manilaclient/latest/cli/osc_plugin_cli.html>`_ to find command
    syntax and usage information. You may also view this documentation
    directly in the CLI with ``openstack help share <subcommand>``. For
    example, ``openstack help share create``.
  - Users can now specify metadata while creating their share snapshots.
    The behavior should be similar to Manila shares, where users are able
    to query snapshots filtering by their metadata and also update and
    delete the metadata of the given resources.
  - The Ceph NFS driver now allows users to consume NFS clusters deployed
    using cephadm. This presents many advantages, since the operator no
    longer needs to maintain their own instances of NFS Ganesha apart of the
    Ceph cluster.
  - The share replica creation now accepts a share network parameter during
    the creation of a share.
  - The Macrosan driver was added to Manila. Administrators are now able
    to add existing Macrosan storage to their clouds.
