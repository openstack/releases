cycle-highlights:
  - Users can specify affinity based provisioning hints when creating
    shares. Hints are tracked through the lifetime of the shares, and
    affect further lifecycle operations such as share migration.
  - Share servers can now be live migrated across storage systems by
    preserving network allocations. Cloud administrators have a "check"
    utility that verifies if a nondisruptive/live share server migration
    is feasible.
  - Feature parity between the manilaclient shell utility and the unified
    OpenStackCLI has increased significantly enhancing usability of
    the Shared File Systems API.
  - Performance enhancements have been committed to pagination and filtering
    of several resources.
  - A new share driver has been added to support Pure Storage Flashblade
    storage systems and it allows provisioning and managing of NFS shares.
  - The NetApp driver added support for petabyte scale filesystems.
    It also added support for "readable" replication of shares alongside
    "dr" (disaster recovery) style replication. Users can mount read-only
    copies of their shares provisioned across availability zones while
    still having read/write access to the primary share.
