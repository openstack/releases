cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Improved handling of user quotas around the creation of temporary
    resources.  This includes the display of information in the
    volume or snapshot detail response in Block Storage API microversion
    3.65 concerning whether that resource consumes quota, and the ability
    to filter a requested list of resources according to whether they
    consume quota or not.
  - |
    Block Storage API microversion 3.66 removes the necessity to add a 'force'
    flag when requesting a snapshot of an in-use volume, given that this is
    not a problem for modern storage systems.
  - |
    Enhancement of the volume-type detail response to include non-sensitive
    "extra-specs" information in order to provide more data for automated
    systems to select a volume type.  Additionally, the volume type list can
    be filtered by these non-sensitive extra-specs using the current Block
    Storage API list filtering syntax for extra-specs.
  - |
    Removal of the long-deprecated Block Storage API version 2.  But not to
    fear, Block Storage API version 3.0 was designed to be completely
    compatible with version 2.  We're at microversion 3.66 in the Xena
    release, so you'll want to get acquainted with all our great new features
    anyway.
  - |
    Many current backend storage drivers have added support for features
    exceeding the required driver functions, for example, multiattach and
    the ability to take advantage of backend optimizations.
