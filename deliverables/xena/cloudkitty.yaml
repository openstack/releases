    Adds an option to enable the use of custom queries with the Gnocchi
    collector. Operators are now able to take full advantage of functions
    that are available on Gnocchi such as any arithmetic operation,
    logical operation and many others.

    We changed the `state` field in `cloudkitty_storage_states` table. The
    goal is to use a more descriptive and meaningful name
    ( `last_processed_timestamp`).

    The new "NOTNUMBOOL" mutator has been added. This mutator is, essentially,
    an opposite of the "NUMBOOL" mutator as it returns 1.0 when quantity is 0
    and 0.0 otherwise.
