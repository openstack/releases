    Nova now supports `Cyborg managed SmartNICs
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/accelerator-support.html#using-sriov-with-cyborg>`_
    represented by Neutron ports and attached as SRIOV devices to the Nova servers.

    Nova's libvirt virt driver now supports any PCI devices, not just virtual GPUs, that are using
    the ``VFIO-mdev`` virtualization framework like network adapters or compute accelerators.
    `See more in the spec <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/xena/approved/generic-mdevs.html>`_

    Nova stores the cinder volume connection_info in its database. Over time this information can
    become stale if changes are made in the environment, the most common example of which being the
    changing of MON IP addresses when using Ceph as the backing store for the Cinder volume service.
    Previously operators have had to query the database directly for an understanding of the current
    state of the connection_info and could only migrate or shelve the instance to force a refresh
    of this. Now Nova provides a set of ``nova-manage``
    `CLI commands <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#volume-attachment-commands>`_
    to read and refresh the stale information.

    `API microversion 2.90 <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/api-microversion-history.html#maximum-in-xena>`_
    allows users to configure the hostname that will be exposed via the nova metadata service when
    creating or rebuilding their instance.
