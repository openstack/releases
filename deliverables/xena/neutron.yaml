cycle-highlights:
  - Distributed DHCP service is now available as an neutron-ovs-agent extension.
    It provides basic DHCP functionality locally on compute nodes where VMs are
    and no DHCP agents are needed in such case.
  - Support stateless security groups with the latest OVN 21.06+. The
    ``stateful=False`` security groups are mapped to the new ``allow-stateless``
    OVN ACL verb.
  - ECMP routes are now supported by Neutron. Multiple routes with the same
    destination address are now consolidated into a single ECMP route.
  - A new quota driver is added ``DbQuotaNoLockDriver``. This driver does not
    create a unique lock per (resource, project_id). Such locks could lead to a
    database deadlock state if the number of server requests exceeds the number
    of resolved resource creations.
