cycle-highlights:
  - Distributed DHCP service is now available as an neutron-ovs-agent
    extension. It provides basic DHCP functionality locally on compute
    nodes where VMs are and no DHCP agents are needed in such case.
  - Support stateless security groups with the latest OVN 21.06+. The
    ``stateful=False`` security groups are mapped to the new ``allow-stateless``
    OVN ACL verb.
  - ECMP routes are now supported by Neutron. Multiple routes with the
    same destination address are now consolidated into a single ECMP
    route.
  - A new quota driver is added ``DbQuotaNoLockDriver``. This driver
    does not create a unique lock per (resource, project_id). Such locks
    could lead to a database deadlock state if the number of server
    requests exceeds the number of resolved resource creations.
