team: manila
type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - Users are now able to modify the access level of an access rule,
    switching it from "read-only" to "read-write" or vice versa.
  - Users can now set and modify share server characteristics via share
    network subnet metadata. Cloud administrators can define what modifications
    are permissible via the ``driver_updatable_subnet_metadata`` configuration
    option.
  - The NetApp ONTAP driver now supports Certificate Based Authentication.
  - The configuration options for the standalone CephFS NFS Ganesha
    helper are deprecated and will be removed in the future, along with
    the helper. Operators are expected to migrate to use highly-available
    NFS-Ganesha clusters (a.k.a "ceph nfs" service) instead.
  - The NetApp ONTAP driver was improved to prevent future failures
    on HA takeovers on the storage back end through improved provisioning.
  - The CephFS driver will now report allocated capacity in gigabytes
    to the scheduler calculations to ensure that shares are being evenly
    distributed across backends.
  - We improved the durability of exports in the generic driver to sustain
    crashes, restarts or planned migrations of the underlying share
    servers.
