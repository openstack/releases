cycle-highlights:
  - |
    New kernel vfio-PCI variant drivers like nvidia GRID on Ubuntu 24.04 are
    now supported by our PCI passthrough feature. You can create instances
    using those specific PCI devices but also live migrate them.
  - |
    Manila shares can now be directly attached to instances by a new Nova
    shares API.
  - |
    A new ImagePropertiesWeigher is able to spread or pack instances using the
    same image properties.
  - |
    The nova-scheduler service now does leader election in an attempt to have
    only one run host discovery periodically (if configured) instead of all of
    them running it all the time in parallel.
  - |
    Image properties and scheduler hints are now returned as part of the
    instance show API response.
  - |
    Nova added support for the IGB VIF model.
  - |
    Unified limits are no longer experimental since we added a nova-manage tool
    for migrating existing quota limits to Keystone automatically and given
    we added new configuration options for telling which resource classes
    are either required or ignored.
  - |
    Nova now supports a new console type called `spice-direct`Â  if you define
    a specific SPICE protocol native proxy URL (eg. a kerbside URL). Direct
    SPICE VDI consoles enable a much richer virtual desktop experience.
