    With the introduction of testing on ubuntu 24.04, watcher now support python
    3.12 and has removed support for 3.8. This involved enhancing compatibility
    with modern versions of eventlet, SQLAlchemy and apscheduler on newer python
    runtimes.

    A new Prometheus data source has been added, the obsolete Ceilometer API
    data source has been removed, and the Monasca data source has been deprecated.
