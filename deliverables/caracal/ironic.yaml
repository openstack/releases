cycle-highlights:
  - Ironic has enabled RBAC support by default by changing the default
    values of ``[oslo_policy]enforce_scope`` and ``[oslo_policy]enforce_new_defaults``
    to ``True``. Additionally, we added ``[DEFAULT]rbac_service_project_name``
    to define a project where users in that project are treated as having
    a service role. Please see Ironic release notes for full details.
  - Ironic has added the ability to drain active tasks from a conductor
    before shutdown. Sending a ``SIGUSR2`` signal to an ironic-conductor
    will now attempt to complete running tasks with a timeout of ``[DEFAULT]drain_shutdown_timeout``.
    No new tasks will be started on the conductor while it's draining.
  - Ironic now has basic testing for OVN-based deployments, using the
    OVN DHCP service. This includes lightly tested support for OVN VTEP
    switches. Operators considering use of this support should read
    `Ironic OVN documentation 
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/ovn-networking.html>`_
    for more information and details on limitations.
  - Several Ironic drivers have been deprecated in favor of more modern,
    redfish-based drivers. The ``ibmc``, ``xclarity``, and ``idrac-wsman``
    drivers will be removed during a future development cycle. Operators
    utilizing these drivers are encouraged to use the redfish hardware
    type instead. Additionally, users of the ``ilo`` hardware type on
    newer ILO6-based hardware will now be prompted to use ``redfish``
    instead.
  - Ironic now supports UEFI HTTP mode booting. The ``http`` boot interface
    is based upon the ``pxe`` interface, and ``http-ipxe`` is based
    upon ``ipxe``.
  - Ironic now supports in-band inspection and node auto-discovery without
    an additional ironic-inspector service. An online data migration
    was added which migrates inspection interface on idle nodes to ``agent``
    if inspector-based inspection is disabled, and agent-based inspection
    is enabled.
  - Ironic will now reserve a small number of worker threads for user-interactive
    API usage. Previously, an overloaded Ironic cluster could fail API
    calls if many nodes performed provisioning actions at the same time.
  - Ironic now supports pulling down images from a web server authenticated
    using basic auth. This permits standalone Ironic users to secure
    their external image repositories.
