type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - Creating share networks with Manila's UI Dashboard will now follow
    a two-step workflow, as part of a change to support multiple share
    network subnets.
  - Users can specify a custom export location for their shares, making
    mount paths predictable. A prefix should be configured by the administrators,
    else Manila will use the project ID as a prefix to the custom mount
    point name.
  - While disabling a service, you can now specify a reason for it.
    When the service is enabled again, the reason will be automatically
    removed.
  - Administrators are now able to configure metadata options that can
    only be manipulated by more privileged users through a new config
    option.
  - Shares created using the CEPHFS protocol will now feature the backing
    filesystem name in the share metadata, making it easier to mount
    shares.
  - A new driver-advantaged share backup implementation has been added
    with NetApp ONTAP storage systems.
  - Administrators can now enable a deferred approach for share and
    share snapshot deletions. With this approach, user quotas are immediately
    released while deletions are processed within back-end storage systems
    in periodic intervals.
