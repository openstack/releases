release-model: cycle-with-rc
team: magnum
type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - |
    ``RBAC``: API policies new defaults and scope are enabled by default.
  - |
    Support for ``Kubernetes v1.27`` has been added.
  - |
    Multiple drivers offering the same functionality (e.g. vm, ubuntu,
    kubernetes) can now be installed and selected by Cluster Template instead
    of a single driver suppressing the other.
  - |
    Magnum will now no longer keep image tag labels (e.g. cloud_provider_tag,
    flannel_tag) static. Please specify explicitly all image tags for the
    images your Cluster Templates will be using, to prevent a future change
    breaking your Cluster Templates. Refer to the documentation under
    ``Supported Labels`` for a list of labels Magnum is tested with.
  - |
    Project gating for Heat driver cluster creation and testing has been added.
  - |
    Deprecated drivers ``k8s_coreos_v1``, ``k8s_fedora_atomic_v1``,
    ``k8s_fedora_ironic_v1`` and ``Docker Swarm`` have been removed.
  - |
    ``Cilium`` ``Kubernetes`` network driver has been added to supported
    CNI list. No in-tree drivers deploy Cilium this cycle, but out-of-tree
    drivers may now implement this CNI.
