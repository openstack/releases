    The Ironic driver ``[ironic]/peer_list`` configuration option has been
    deprecated. The Ironic driver now more closely models other Nova drivers by
    having a single compute have exclusive control over assigned nodes. If high
    availability of a single compute service is required, operators should use
    active/passive failover. Now, Ironic nova-compute services can target a
    specific shard of ironic nodes by setting the ``[ironic]/shard``
    configuration option and a new ``nova-manage db ironic_compute_node_move``
    command can help the operators when upgrading their computes and telling
    which shard they could use.

    Instances using `vGPUs can now be correctly live-migrated
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/virtual-gpu.html#caveats>`_
    if both of the compute nodes support libvirt-8.6.0 and QEMU-8.1.0, as the
    source mediated device will migrate the GPU memory to another target
    mediated device automatically. In order to do this,
    ``[libvirt/live_migration_downtime`` config option needs to be modified
    according to the aforementioned documentation.

    As of the new 2.96 microversion, when asking the API for a server show or a
    server list, it returns a new parameter called ``pinned_availability_zone``
    that indicates whether the instance is confined to a specific AZ or if it
    can be migrated to another one.
  - |
    Instances using virtio-net will see an increase in performance between 10%
    and 20% if their image uses a new ``hw:virtio_packed_ring=true`` property
    or their flavor contains ``hw_virtio_packed_ring=true`` extra spec,
    provided libvirt version is >= 6.3 and QEMU >= 4.2.
  - |
    As a security mechanism, a new ``[consoleauth]/enforce_session_timeout``
    configuration option provides the ability to automatically close a server
    console session when the token expires.
  - |
    Users can `boot instances with large RAM
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/2023.1/approved/libvirt-maxphysaddr-support.html#flavor-extra-specs>`_
    by specifying either through flavor extra specs
    ``hw:maxphysaddr_mode=emulate`` and ``hw:maxphysaddr_bits`` or by image
    properties ``hw_maxphysaddr_mode`` and ``hw_maxphysaddr_bits``.

    The Hyper-V virt driver has been removed. It was deprecated in the Nova
    27.2.0 (Antelope) release. This driver was untested and has no maintainers.
    In addition, it had a dependency on the OpenStack Winstacker project that
    also has been retired.
  - |
    A couple of other improvements target reducing the number of bugs we have :
    one automatically detecting the maximum number of instances with memory
    encryption which can run concurrently, another one allowing to specific an
    IP address or hostname for incoming move operations (by setting
    ``[libvirt]/migration_inbound_addr``) and yet another one defining aliases
    for libvirt disks as a defined identifier to look at.
