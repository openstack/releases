cycle-highlights:
  - Support was added for the external-gateway-multihoming API extension.
    The L3 service plugins supporting it can now create multiple gateway
    ports per router. It is currently limited to the L3 OVN plugin.
  - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and Equal-Cost Multi-Path
    (ECMP) configuration options are now supported on default routes.
    Both configuration options have a default value of ‘False’ and are
    only supported with the OVN driver.
  - Metadata over IPv6 is now supported in the OVN driver.
  - The L3 OVN scheduler was updated to better distribute gateways over
    chassis in different eligible Availability Zones (AZs), making it
    more resilient to failure.
