  - Added the support to configure weight for each store to get rid
    of the problem with existing location strategy while downloading
    the image from specific store when multiple stores of same type
    are available.
  - Added support for RBD driver to move images to the trash if they
    cannot be deleted immediately due to having snapshots.
