cycle-highlights:
  - |
    The Ironic driver ``[ironic]/peer_list`` configuration option has been
    deprecated. The Ironic driver now more closely models other Nova drivers by
    having a single compute have exclusive control over assigned nodes.
    If high availability of a single compute service is required, operators
    should use active/passive failover.
  - |
    The legacy quota driver is now deprecated and a
    `nova-manage limits command <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#limits-migrate-to-unified-limits>`_
    is provided in order to migrate the orginal limits into Keystone. We plan to
    change the default quota driver to the unified limits driver in an upcoming
    release. It is recommended that you begin planning and executing a migration
    to unified limits as soon as possible.

    QEMU in its TCG mode (i.e. full system emulation) uses a translation
    block (TB) cache as an optimization during dynamic code translation.
    The libvirt driver can now configure the tb-cache size when the virt type is
    ``qemu``. This helps running VMs with small memory size.
    In order to use this feature, a configuration option
    ``[libvirt]/tb_cache_size`` has been introduced.
  - |
    Two new scheduler weighers have been introduced. One helps sorting the nodes
    by the number of active instances they run, the other helps sorting by
    the hypervisor version each compute runs. Accordingly, you can place your
    instances with different strategies, eg. by allocating them to more recent
    nodes or by reducing the number of noisy instance neighbors.
  - |
    It is now possible to define different authorization policies for migration
    with and without a target host.
  - |
    A couple of other improvements target reducing the number of bugs we have,
    one checking at reboot if stale volume attachments still reside and another
    one ensuring a strict linkage between a compute, a service and the instances
    it runs.
