cycle-highlights:
  - Ironic now has support for complex parent-child device topologies. This
    feature, primarily targeted at orchestration of DPUs, allows nodes to have
    parent/child relationships. This allows for more complex logic to be
    coordinated between a node and its children. When a node with children runs
    a step-based action, those steps can include actions to be run on the child
    node. See `parent node documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/cleaning.html#parent-nodes>`_
    for more information.
  - Ironic now has basic support for servicing nodes. Servicing allows
    operators to use steps, like you would for cleaning, to perform service
    on deployed nodes in ``ACTIVE`` state. Previously, Ironic would not
    perform operations on active nodes. See
    `Node servicing documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/servicing>`_
    for more information.
  - Ironic has promoted support for firmware upgrading and information to a
    new interface and API named ``FirmwareInterface``. This includes new API
    support, at ``/v1/nodes/{node_ident}/firmware`` for getting firmware
    information. In addition, operators can use the csteps provided by the new
    ``FirmwareInterface`` their firmware upgrade process for step-based
    automations, such as deployment, cleaning, or servicing. While the structure
    and API is in place for firmware management, our first driver, for redfish
    hardware, is coming next release.
  - Additional steps for servicing, cleaning, and deployment have been added.
    The first new step, ``wait``, waits for a specified amount of time or
    until the next heartbeat. The second new step, ``hold``, stops evaluation
    of steps until the ``unhold`` verb is submitted to the provision state API
    for that node. When a node is held, it will be parked a new "hold"
    provision_state, either ``clean hold``, ``deploy hold`` or
    ``service hold``. Additionally, Ironic has added support for power control
    via steps named, ``power_on``, ``power_off``, and ``reboot``; deployers who
    already have custom steps with these names must rename them. These new steps
    are useful for integrating with external systems that need to perform
    actions on a node or for orchestrating complex workflows involving child
    nodes.
  - Ironic conductor services now honor the value of
    ``[DEFAULT]/graceful_shutdown_timeout``, waiting that number of seconds
    to complete operations before forcing them to abort. 
  - Operators are now able to disable MD5 use to verify images in Ironic by
    setting  ``[agent]/allow_md5_checksum`` to false. This option defaults
    to ``true`` to preserve existing behavior in this release; but we expect
    to disable MD5 support by default in a future release.
