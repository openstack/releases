cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Manila shares and access rules can now be locked against deletion.
    A generic ``resource locks`` framework has been introduced to facilitate
    this. Users can also hide sensitive fields of access rules with this
    feature.
  - |
    Shares can be backed up and restored generically with the help of the
    manila-data manager service. Driver-powered share backups will extend this
    feature in future releases.
  - |
    Added new Manila drivers to support Dell PowerFlex and Dell PowerStore
    storage backends. The driver for PowerFlex supports managing NFS shares
    while the driver for PowerStore supports managing NFS and CIFS shares.
  - |
    Added the NetAppAIQWeigher scheduler weigher that harnesses artificial
    intelligence to handle provisioning and placement decisions.
  - |
    Share access rules can be filtered with rule parameters such as access_to,
    access_type, access_key and access_level.
  - |
    Added the possibility to display the total count of snapshots when
    paginating snapshots.
  - |
    Added share type information to notifications with oslo.messaging. It is
    useful for billing to be able to charge customers differently for shares of
    different types.
  - |
    Administrators are now able to to set a maximum share extend size
    restriction which can be set on a per share-type granularity through the
    ‘provisioning:max_share_extend_size’ extra-spec.
  - |
    Usage of the “manila” CLI client is discouraged in favor of the
    “openstack” CLI. The “manila” CLI client is deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release.
