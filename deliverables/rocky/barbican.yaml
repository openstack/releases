cycle-highlights:
  - |
    A new crypto plugin was added to allow secrets to be stored and generated
    in a HashiCorp Vault.  This plugin uses the castellan vault plugin to
    access the Vault.
  - |
    The PKCS#11 plugin was augmented to allow encryption and HMAC algorithms
    and key parameters to be customized to allow easier integration with Thales
    and ATOS HSMs.  Changes were also made to barbican-manage to allow the key
    types and algorithms to be customized.
  - |
    The simple crypto plugin was augmented to allow the generation of 512 bit
    AES keys for XTS mode.
