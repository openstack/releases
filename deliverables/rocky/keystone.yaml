cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Support for a new hierarchical enforcement model has been implemented in
    addition to several improvements to the unified limits APIs.
  - |
    Parts of keystone's API have converted from a custom WSGI implementation to
    using flask and flask-restful. This may affect people using custom
    middleware or injecting custom paste pipelines.
  - |
    The token provider API has been refactored to have cleaner interfaces,
    reducing technical debt. Deployments using custom token providers may be
    affected.
  - |
    Keystone now creates 2 default roles (``member`` and ``reader``) in
    addition to the ``admin`` role upon installation or bootstrap. These roles
    will be incorporated across other service policies by default in the future
    as an effort to simplify RBAC across OpenStack. Note that this might have
    an impact on deployments given case sensitivity issues with role naming.
    You can read about case sensitivty within keystone in `here
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/rocky/admin/identity-case-insensitive.html>`_.
