cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Improvements were made to minimize network downtime during live migrations.
    In addition, the libvirt driver is now capable of live migrating between
    different types of networking backends, for example, linuxbridge => OVS.
  - |
    Handling of boot from volume instances when the Nova compute host does not
    have enough local storage has been improved.
  - |
    Operators can now disable a cell to make sure no new instances are
    scheduled there. This is useful for operators to introduce new cells to the
    deployment and for maintenance of existing cells.
  - |
    Security enhancements were made when using Glance signed images with the
    libvirt compute driver.
  - |
    A ``nova-manage db purge`` command is now available to help operators with
    maintenance and avoid bloat in their database.
  - |
    The placement service now supports granular RBAC policy rules
    configuration. See the `placement policy
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/placement-policy.html>`_
    documentation for details.
