cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Added support for High Availability kuryr-controller in an Active/Passive
    model, enabling quick and transparent recovery in case kuryr-controller is
    lost.
  - |
    Added native route support enabling L7 routing via Octavia Amphorae instead
    of iptables, providing a more direct routing for load balancers and
    services.
  - |
    Added support for namespace isolation, lettting users isolate pods and
    services in diferent namespaces, implemented through security groups.
  - |
    Added support for health checks of the CNI daemon, letting users confirm
    the CNI daemon's functionality and set limits on resources like memory,
    improving both stability and performance and for it to be marked as
    unhealthy if needed.
  - |
    Added support for multi-vif based on Kubernetes Network Custom Resource
    Definition De-facto Standard spec defined by the Network Plumbing Working
    Group, allowing multiple interfaces per pod.
