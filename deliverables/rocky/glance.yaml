cycle-highlights:
  - Secure Hash Algorithm Support, which allows operators to configure
    a self-describing secure hash that can be used by image consumers
    to verify image data integrity
  - Introduction of "hidden" images, a popular operator request that
    enables operators to keep outdated public images hidden from the
    default image-list response yet still available for server rebuilds
  - The glance-manage utility has been updated to address OpenStack
    Security Note OSSN-0075
  - An implementation of multiple backend support, which allows operators
    to configure multiple stores and allows end users to direct image
    data to a specific store, is introduced as the EXPERIMENTAL Image
    Service API version 2.8
