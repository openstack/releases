cycle-highlights:
  - Added an S3 API compatibility layer, so clients can use S3 clients
    to talk to a Swift cluster.
  - Added container sharding, an operator controlled feature that may
    be used to shard very large container databases into a number of
    smaller shard containers. This mitigates the issues with one large
    DB by distributing the data across multiple smaller databases throughout
    the cluster.
  - TempURLs now support IP range restrictions.
  - The trivial keymaster and the KMIP keymaster now support multiple
    root encryption secrets to enable key rotation.
  - Improved performance of many consistency daemon processes.
  - Added support for the HTTP PROXY protocol to allow for accurate
    client IP address logging when the connection is routed through
    external systems.
