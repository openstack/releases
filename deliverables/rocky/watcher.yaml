cycle-highlights:

    Watcher services can be launched in HA mode. From now on Watcher Decision
    Engine and Watcher Applier services may be deployed on different nodes to
    run in active-active or active-passive mode.
  - |
    Added a host maintenance strategy to prepare compute node for maintenance
    by cleaning up instances via migration.
  - |
    Excluding of instances from audit scope based on project_id is added.
  - |
    Added the ability to ignore specified instances during strategy's (an
    implementation in Watcher) work but still consider the workload they
    produce.
