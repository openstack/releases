cycle-highlights:
  - Ironic has added ``runbooks``, a new API concept to enable self-service
    of maintenance items on nodes by project members. Runbooks are curated
    lists of steps that can be run on nodes only associated via traits
    and used in lieu of an explicit list of steps for manual cleaning
    or servicing. They also follow RBAC rules, allowing projects to
    limit who can CRUD and use a runbook.
  - Ironic has removed the deprecated ``ibmc``, ``xclarity``, and ``idrac-wsman``
    drivers, in favor of more modern, redfish-based drivers.
  - Ironic has extended the functionality of the generic virtual media
    devices API, allowing to fetch the list of virtual media devices
    attached to a node.
  - Ironic has updated the Redfish interoperability profile to version
    1.1.0 that adds a lot of missing resources and fields, and clarifies
    their purpose.
  - Ironic has added the configuration options ``disallowed_enrollment_boot_modes``
    and ``disallowed_deployment_boot_modes`` to allow or disallow specific
    boot modes for node enrollment and/or deployment. By default all
    boot modes are allowed.
  - Ironic now allows to perform firmware updates on active nodes with
    the firmware interface, using the redfish driver firmware update
    feature as a service step.
  - Ironic support for automatically setting the lessee fields on nodes has
    been enhanced to support builds made via Nova, and the feature is enabled
    by default.
  - Ironic has enhanced multiple security aspects, for example it now
    requires rescue passwords to be hashed, it has reduced the logged
    nodes information during the cleaning phase to avoid showing sensitive
    data, and it has hardened the communication between the ironic services
    and the ironic agent requiring an HTTPS url by default.
  - Ironic now discourages the use of ``partition`` images, in favor
    of ``whole disk images``. UEFI Partition images, where EFI assets
    are copied from a partition image, are the only partition images
    Ironic intends to test on a regular basis moving forward.
