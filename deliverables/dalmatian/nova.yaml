cycle-highlights:
  - |
    With the libvirt driver and libvirt version 7.3.0 or newer, mediated
    devices for vGPUs are now persisted across reboots of a compute host.
  - |
    Instances with UEFI firmware can now be launched with stateless firmware if
    their image has the ``hw_firmware_stateless`` property and if the compute
    services have libvirt 8.6.0 or later.
  - |
    Nova now automatically detects vTPM support for compute services if
    libvirt version is above 8.0.0 and if ``swtpm`` is installed on the node.
    It will also automatically get the TPM models that are supported.
  - |
    You can now require TLS connections for SPICE consoles if you set the
    ``[spice]/require_secure`` configuration option to ``True``.
  - |
    ``AggregateMultitenancyIsolation`` scheduler filter now supports multiple
    aggregate keys prefixed by ``filter_tenant_id`` which removes the
    limitation on the number of tenants an aggregate of hosts can relate to.
  - |
    A couple of other improvements target reducing the number of bugs we have:
    one is changing how the Ironic driver sends metadata to the Ironic API, and
    another one created a new ``nova.wsgi`` WSGI module that allows different
    WSGI servers to set their WSGI application the same way (using module
    instead of a binary).
