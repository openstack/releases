cycle-highlights:
  - Manager role support was added to the Neutron APIs, meeting the
    next phase of the Secure RBAC community goals.
  - All supported mechanism drivers (ML2/OVS, ML2/OVN) can now use the
    WSGI API module, completing the first phase of eventlet library
    deprecation.
  - Changed from using ``subquery`` to ``selectin`` for the DB load
    strategy, which should increase performance and reduce complexity.
  - OVN routers can now be attached to tunnelled external gateway networks.
  - Support was added for nested SNAT in the ML2/OVN driver, bringing
    it in line with existing behavior in other drivers.
