type: trailing
cycle-highlights:
  - Added support for deployment on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)
  - Ansible Core version is updated to 2.17 series.
  - |
    Adopted usage of deb822 format for APT repositories for Debian and Ubuntu.
    This is not a backwards compatible change, so all deployments defining
    custom repositories will need to adapt their variables to match the
    deb822 format during upgrade.
  - |
    All playbooks were moved into the openstack.osa collection.
    They were also renamed to better describe the playbook purpose.
    So now you can run playbooks like this from any directory:
    ``openstack-ansible openstack.osa.nova``
    Playbooks inside the integrated repository were left for backwards
    compatibility, but they simply import the corresponding playbook
    from the openstack.osa collection.
