cycle-highlights:
  - Added support of new add/get location APIs which replaces the image-update
    (old location-add) mechanism for consumers like cinder and nova
    to address ``OSSN-0090`` and ``OSSN-0065``.
  - Removed deprecated ``location_strategy`` functionality which was
    used to prioritize location order for downloading the image.
  - Deprecated ``metadata_encryption_key`` config option since it's
    related functionality doesn't serve the purpose of encryption of
    location metadata.
