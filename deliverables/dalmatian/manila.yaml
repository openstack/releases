cycle-highlights:
  - A new share driver has been added to allow provisioning and managing NFS
    shares with a VAST DATA Storage appliance. Users can also take
    point-in-time backups of these shares through snapshots.
  - Users now have the ability to manipulate storage capabilities through share
    metadata. Cloud operators can determine which capabilities are updatable;
    and users are notified about the status of the updates through asynchronous
    user messages.
  - It is now possible to specify pre-created NetApp ONTAP efficiency policies
    through the use of the ``netapp:efficiency_policy`` share type extra spec.
  - The ``manila-manage service list`` command can now provide the response in
    json and yaml formats.
  - The NetApp ONTAP driver now supports creating Write Once Read Many (WORM)
    shares through the use of the NetApp storage SnapLock feature.
  - Manila now supports scheduling shares on hosts that are currently running
    and marked as being under maintenance (disabled).
  - When creating access rules with a deletion lock, the corresponding shares
    will also be locked to prevent disconnections.
  - Users can now set and unset metadata on share export locations. The
    behavior is similar to Manila shares. A new configuration option named
    ``admin_only_el_metadata`` was added in order to allow administrators
    to prevent end users to update certain metadata keys.
  - Cloud operators can now refresh share export locations through a new API
    instead of restarting Manila's share manager service. This improves the
    uptime and availability of the cloud.
  - The Shared File Systems service now requires a user's scope
    to be set within the OpenStack Identity service by default.
    This behavior can be turned off, however, it is highly discouraged to do
    so.
