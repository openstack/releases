        - Several bug fixes and support added for new microversions. The
          highest supported microversion in this release is 2.35.
        - The CLI now goes directly to the Image service and Network service
          when translating resource name to ID. For example, booting a server
          with an image name or network name will use Glance and Neutron rather
          than proxy through the Compute API. See the release notes for more
          information.
        - Routine dependency updates.

        - Several bug fixes and support added for new microversions. The
          highest supported microversion in this release is 2.37.
        - The network resource CLIs and APIs are now deprecated because
          nova-network is deprecated.
        - The image, baremetal and network APIs are now all capped at
          microversion 2.35 since they result in a 404 from the Nova API after
          microversion 2.35.
        - The 2.37 microversion is now supported for booting a server with
          automatically allocated networking, a.k.a get me a network. With that
          change the "nics" kwarg is required when booting a server via the
          Server API after microversion 2.36. The CLI will default to 'auto' if
          nothing is specified.
        - Routine dependency updates.
