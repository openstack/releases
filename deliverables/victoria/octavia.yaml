type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - Users can now specify the TLS versions accepted for listeners and
    pools. Operators also now have the ability to set a minimum TLS
    version acceptable for their deployment.
  - Octavia now supports HTTP/2 over TLS using the new Application Layer
    Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) configuration option for listeners.
  - Load balancer statistics can now be reported to multiple statistics
    drivers simultaneously and supports delta metrics. This allows easier
    integration into external metrics system, such as a time series
    database.
  - Octavia flavors for the amphora driver now support specifying the
    glance image tag as part of the flavor. This allows the operator
    to define Octavia flavors that boot alternate amphora images.
  - Load balancer pools now support version two of the PROXY protocol.
    This allows passing client information to member servers when using
    TCP protocols. PROXYV2 improves the performance of establishing
    new connections using the PROXY protocol to member servers, especially
    when the listener is using IPv6.
