    Tenant driven share replication, a self-service aid to data protection,
    disaster recovery and high availability is now generally available and
    fully supported. Starting with API version 2.56, the
    ``X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Experimental`` header is no longer required to
    create/promote/resync/delete share replicas.
  - |
    Share server migration is now available as an experimental feature. Share
    servers provide hard multi-tenancy guarantees by isolating shared file
    systems in the network path. In this release, cloud administrators
    are able to move share servers to different backends or share networks.
