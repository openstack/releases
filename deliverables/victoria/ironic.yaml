cycle-highlights:
  - The `deploy steps <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/node-deployment.html>`_
    work has decomposed the basic deployment operation into multiple
    steps which can now also include steps from supported RAID and BIOS
    interfaces at the time of deploy.
  - An ``agent`` power interface enables `provisioning operations <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/agent-power.html>`_
    without a Baseboard Management Controller.
  - Ironic can now be configured for `HTTP Basic authentication <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/standalone.html#service-settings>`_
    without the need for additional services.
  - Adds initial support for `DHCP-less based deployments <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/drivers/redfish.html#layer-3-or-dhcp-less-ramdisk-booting>`_
    with Redfish Virtual Media.
