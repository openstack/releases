    location: 10.0.0.0rc1
cycle-highlights:
  - Adds ability for operators to override, per failure type, the instance
    metadata key controlling the behaviour of Masakari towards the instance.
    This makes it possible to differentiate between instance- and host-level
    failures per instance.
