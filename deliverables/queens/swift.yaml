cycle-highlights:
  - Added symlink objects support. Symlink objects reference one other
    object in the cluster. Read requests pass through the symlink on to
    the target objects. Write requests act on the symlink itself.
  - Added support for inline data segments in Static Large Object (SLO)
    manifests. These data segments do not refer to another object in the
    system but are included directly in the manifest. When using data
    segments instead of small objects in the cluster, users will much
    improved performance on reads. The data segments can also be used to
    construct composite file formats (like .tar) without needing to create
    objects in the cluster for boilerplate data.
  - Added checksum to object extended attributes. This provides better
    durability guarantees for data stored in the system.
  - The object expiry functionality was greatly improved to be much more
    efficient with cluster resources, especially when operating on
    erasure code objects.
  - The tempurl digest algorithm is now configurable, and Swift added
    support for both SHA-256 and SHA-512. Supported tempurl digests
    are exposed to clients in ``/info``. Additionally, tempurl signatures
    can now be base64 encoded.
