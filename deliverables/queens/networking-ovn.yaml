cycle-highlights:
  - OVN NorthBound backend database consistency mechanism, multiple
    workers are now completely safe to access the backend database,
    and any inconsistency generated by the backend not being available
    is quickly detected and corrected by a periodic job
  - OVN DNS support. ovn-controller will respond to DNS queries locally
    on each compute node.
  - OVN distributed Floating IP support.
  - OVN L3 HA support for gateway routers. Now networking-ovn makes
    use of the OVN embedded mechanism for L3 high availability. It will
    be automatically used for any router as soon as more than one gateway
    node is available.
  - OVN supports IPv6 Router solicitation and IPv6 Periodic router advertisement
    support.
  - OVN supports binding SR-IOV ports on OVS > 2.8 and kernel >=4.8
