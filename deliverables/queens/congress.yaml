cycle-highlights:
  - 'Mistral Integration: Congress can now trigger workflows according
    to operator-defined policy. From sending emails to running ansible
    playbooks, Congress and Mistral can take infrastructure automation
    and fault-recovery to the next level.'
  - 'Config Validation: To help operators catch improper, insecure,
    or incompatible configurations across the Stack, the new configuration
    validation facility enables Congress to monitor service configurations
    according to policy.'
  - 'Tag-based Security: To help operators secure and manage self-service
    infrastructure, Congress now supports enforcement of application-based
    network security policies based on tags and other semantic information.'
  - 'Bug Fixes: As with every release, we continue to make Congress
    more robust and stable than ever.'
