cycle-highlights:
  - The agent extension for BGPVPN was refactored to use new extensible
    RPCs, and now covers most the BGPVPN API including the bgpvpn-routes-control
    extension.
  - The ML2 implementation now works with the vxlan type driver.
  - The project now provides a driver for the networking-sfc project,
    internally relying on BGP VPNs to setup service chains.
