    `PCI devices can now be scheduled <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/pci-passthrough.html#pci-tracking-in-placement>`_
    by Nova using the Placement API on a opt-in basis. This will help the
    nova-scheduler service to better schedule flavors that use PCI
    (non-Neutron related) resources, will generate less reschedules if an
    instance cannot be created on a candidate and will help the nova-scheduler
    to not miss valid candidates if the list was too large.
  - |
    Operators can now ask Nova to `manage the power consumption of dedicated
    CPUs <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/cpu-topologies.html#configuring-cpu-power-management-for-dedicated-cores>`_
    so as to either offline them or change their governor if they're
    currently not in use by any instance or if the instance is stopped.
  - |
    Nova will prevent unexpected compute service renames by `persisting a unique
    compute UUID on local disk <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/compute-node-identification.html>`_.
    This stored UUID will be considered the source of truth for knowing whether
    the compute service hostame has been modified or not. As a reminder,
    changing a compute hostname is forbidden, particularly when this compute is
    currently running instances on top of it.
  - |
    `SPICE consoles <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/remote-console-access.html#spice-console>`_
    can now be configured with compression settings which include choices of the
    compression algorithm and the compression mode.
  - Fully-Qualified Domain Names are now considered valid for an instance
    hostname if you use the 2.94 API microversion.
  - By opting into 2.95 API microversion, evacuated instances will remain
    stopped on the destination host until manually started.
