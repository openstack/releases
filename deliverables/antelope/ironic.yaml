cycle-highlights:
  - Adds support for service role in default policy, intended for service
    to service communication.
  - Ironic can now export application metrics from the ironic-conductor
    service into prometheus, alongside hardware metrics. Previously
    these were only accessible via statsd.
  - Adds support for sharding Ironic nodes using a shard-key, to enable
    external API clients to horizontal scale. See https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/baremetal/#shards
    for more information.
  - Performance on the /v1/ports and /v1/portgroups API list endpoints
    has been improved.
