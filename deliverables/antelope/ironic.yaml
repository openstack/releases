cycle-highlights:
  - Adds support for service role in default policy, intended for service to
    service communication.
  - Ironic can now export application metrics from the ironic-conductor
    service into prometheus, alongside hardware metrics. Previously these
    were only accessible via statsd.
  - Adds support for sharding Ironic nodes using a shard-key, to enable
    external API clients to horizontal scale. See
    https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/baremetal/#shards for more information.
  - Performance on the /v1/ports and /v1/portgroups API list endpoints has
    been improved.
