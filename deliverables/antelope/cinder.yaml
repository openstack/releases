launchpad: cinder
release-model: cycle-with-rc
team: cinder
type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - |
    New backend drivers were added: HPE XP iSCSI and FC,
    Fungible NVMe-TCP, NetApp NVMe-TCP storage drivers.
  - |
    Many features were added to current drivers. Notable examples are Trisync
    replication support for Pure driver, volume group snapshot support for
    IBM SVF driver, Unisphere 10 support for Dell EMC PowerMax driver and
    Host assisted migration and retype support for Hitachi VSP driver.
    Apart from driver features, we also made improvements in the NVMe target
    driver to add support for LVM+nvmet to enable CI testing even in the
    absence of an NVMe backend.
  - |
    Many small bug fixes and improvements in operator experience, especially
    around the cinder backup service, for example, incremental backup issue in
    POSIX driver, create backup issue when volume doesn't exist, etc, were fixed.
