cycle-highlights:
  - APIs for transferring shares between projects are now available. When
    triggered, the transfer will create a key to be used by a user in the
    destination project.
  - Users can now specify metadata while creating their share networks.
    The behavior should be similar to Manila shares, and users will be able
    to update and delete the metadata of the given resources.
