cycle-highlights:
  - APIs for transferring shares between projects are now available.
    When triggered, the transfer will create a key to be used by a user
    in the destination project.
  - Users can now specify metadata while creating their share networks.
    The behavior should be similar to Manila shares, and users will
    be able to update and delete the metadata of the given resources.
