type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Added a new option to randomize host selection for physical host
    reservations. This prevents Blazar from always allocating the same hosts.
  - |
    Added Resource Allocations API support in the Blazar command-line client.
    This allows operators to query active and pending allocations for specific
    hosts, or find which hosts are allocated to a specific reservation.
