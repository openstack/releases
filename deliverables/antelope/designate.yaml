  - Designate zones can now be shared across multiple projects. This not only
    allows two or more projects to manage recordsets in the zone, but enables
    “Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation” (RFC 2317) in Designate. Classless
    IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation allows IP address DNS PTR record assignment in
    smaller blocks without creating a DNS zone per address.
