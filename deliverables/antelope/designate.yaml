cycle-highlights:
  - Designate zones can now be shared across multiple projects. This
    not only allows two or more projects to manage recordsets in the
    zone, but enables “Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation” (RFC 2317)
    in Designate. Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation allows IP address
    DNS PTR record assignment in smaller blocks without creating a DNS
    zone per address.
