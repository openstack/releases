launchpad: skyline-apiserver
release-model: cycle-with-rc
team: skyline
type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - Fully upgrade Fixed IP filtering capabilities, covering server
    lists, recycled servers, instance pages and server group
    detail pages, supporting precise frontend filtering to improve
    resource location efficiency.
  - Add a rescue feature for Nova instances, providing a fast
    recovery path for instance failure scenarios (e.g., system
    crashes, configuration anomalies) and improving instance
    lifecycle management.
  - 'Optimize architecture and cross-environment compatibility: convert
    asynchronous code to synchronous to simplify maintenance and update
    fastapi; resolve the issue of OpenSSL not supporting md4 by default
    in Ubuntu 24.04+ via Monkey patch to ensure normal yarn build.'
  - 'Enhance user experience: persist menu collapse status via local
    storage; pause list auto-refresh when data fetch fails and update
    policy check error messages to reduce invalid operations.'
  - 'Strengthen HTTPS communication security: enable TLSv1.2/TLSv1.3
    for upstream endpoints to fix handshake errors caused by old TLS
    versions, complying with modern encryption standards.'
  - 'Improve deployment configuration flexibility: add access_log_file
    and error_log_file parameters, supporting default, relative and
    absolute (e.g., Kubernetes containerized) log paths to adapt to
    diverse deployment needs.'
