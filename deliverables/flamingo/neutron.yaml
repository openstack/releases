cycle-highlights:
  - Neutron API, RPC, agents (metadata, DHCP, L3, etc), workers and all
    associated code now runs in native threading mode instead of eventlet.
  - A new custom API policy rule ``context_with_global_access`` has been
    added, which allows for roles such as ``auditor`` to be specified.
  - Floating IP NAT rules in OVN can now be configured as stateless
    with the ``stateless_nat_enabled`` option, which can potentially improve
    performance because it avoids conntrack.
  - The OVN agent has replaced the OVN Metadata Agent, the latter will
    be deprecated in a future release.
