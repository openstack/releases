    Added a new API endpoint for credential rotation of an existing cluster.
    This endpoint may be used to regularly rotate any Application Credentials or
    Keystone Trusts as implemented by the driver. This can be used as a security
    measure, to migrate cluster ownership to a different user account, or to
    recreate credentials that have become invalidated by removal of roles from a
    user.
