cycle-highlights:
  - |
    The libvirt guest XML now includes additional flavor and image metadata
    fields so that it can be used during troubleshooting or services like
    Ceilometer can retrieve accurate instance information directly, without
    performing extra Nova API calls.
  - |
    Nova now supports a new default role ``manager`` which is scoped to the
    project level. This role is part of the standard role hierarchy supported
    by Keystone and allows trusted project users to perform project-level
    management tasks (e.g., live migration) without requiring full admin
    rights.
  - |
    Service-to-service APIs now use the ``service`` role, reducing unnecessary
    privileges for cross-service communication.
  - |
    Nova now supports one-time use passthrough devices. Such devices are
    allocated to a single instance, and when the instance is deleted,
    the device stays in a reserved state instead of becoming automatically
    available. This ensures operators can perform necessary security checks
    or hardware resets before reusing the device.
  - |
    Completes SPICE direct consoles with USB controller config and sound device support.
  - |
    Nova now supports QEMU’s memory balloon autodeflate and free page reporting
    features with the libvirt driver. These allow unused guest memory to be
    automatically released back to the hypervisor, improving memory efficiency
    and reducing the risk of the Out-of-Memory killer activating.
  - |
    Added support for AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization – Encrypted State
    (SEV-ES) with libvirt, extending confidential computing capabilities in
    Nova to protect guest memory and CPU register state.
  - |
    Experimental feature: Nova API, metadata, and scheduler services can
    run in native threading mode as an alternative to eventlet. Please try
    it in non-production environment and share your success or failure with
    us on the openstack-discuss mailing list or via the Nova bug tracker.
