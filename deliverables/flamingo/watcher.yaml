cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Volume migrations now use secure Cinder operations, eliminating
    previous security vulnerabilities while maintaining full functionality.
    Undocumented and unimplemented API endpoints have been removed for
    improved security posture.
  - |
    Operators can now skip specific optimization actions with custom
    status messages, providing granular control over infrastructure
    changes during maintenance windows.
  - |
    Host Maintenance strategy now offers granular controls for
    live and cold migration scenarios, giving operators precise
    control over workload placement during maintenance.
  - |
    Watcher now integrates with Prometheus through the new Aetos
    data source, providing secure multi-tenant monitoring with
    Keystone authentication and role-based access control.
  - |
    Python 3.10 is now the minimum requirement, ensuring compatibility
    with modern OpenStack deployments and improved performance.
  - |
    Optional Monasca client integration reduces dependencies on
    retired components without breaking existing user configurations.
