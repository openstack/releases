cycle-highlights:
  - Horizon now uses SDK instead of neutronclient for RBAC policies,
    QoS and Security groups
  - User Credentials details page for TOTP now displays a generated
    QR code to set up a new TOTP in an authentication app
  - Region and domain selection is now always visible on the login
    screen, independently of authentication methods, making multiple
    regions and domains setups possible.
