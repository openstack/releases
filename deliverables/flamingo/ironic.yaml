cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Ironic has transitioned from Eventlet to native OS threading, modernizing
    the codebase architecture. While expected to have an overall positive
    impact on performance, this may change the RAM and CPU usage patterns
    on machines running Ironic services. For details on this change,
    https://ironicbaremetal.org/blog/coming-soon-threading/ is a good
    resource.
  - |
    Enhanced inspection capabilities with support for inspection hooks and
    inspection rules in the Redfish inspect interface, enabling customized
    hardware discovery and validation workflows during node inspection.
  - |
    Automated cleaning can now optionally be defined via runbooks, providing
    a declarative alternative to the imperative in-band step detection model,
    allowing operators to define standardized, reusable cleaning workflows
    upfront when desired.
  - |
    Improved observability with step flow details now captured in node
    history, providing operators with detailed insights into provisioning
    and maintenance operations for troubleshooting and auditing.
