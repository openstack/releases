    share servers. To achieve such behavior, the user must specify

    servers. This functionality is only available in multitenancy
    mode (DHSS=True).

    from its source.
  - The Dell Isilon Driver was rebranded to PowerScale.
  - The Dell PowerScale driver now supports thin provisioning for
